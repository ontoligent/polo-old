CH01-P1,CH01,the sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel it not like i using case heard someone say as he shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the chat it like my body developed this massive drug deficiency it was a sprawl voice and a sprawl joke the chatsubo was a bar for professional expatriates you could drink there for a week and never hear two words in japanese ratz was tending bar his prosthetic arm jerking monotonously as he filled a tray of glasses with draft kirin he saw case and smiled his teeth a web work of east european steel and brown decay case found a place at the bar between the unlikely tan on one of lonny zone whores and the crisp naval uniform of a tall african whose cheekbones were ridged with joe boys ratz said shoving a draft across the bar with his good hand maybe some business with you case case shrugged the girl to his right giggled and nudged
CH01-P2,CH01,the bartender smile widened his ugliness was the stuff of legend in an age of affordable beauty there was something heraldic about his lack of it the antique arm whined as he reached for another mug it was a russian military prosthesis a seven function force feedback manipulator cased in grubby pink plastic you are too much the artiste herr case ratz grunted the sound served him as laughter he scratched his overhang of white shirted belly with the pink claw you are the artiste of the slightly funny deal sure case said and sipped his beer somebody gotta be funny around here sure the fuck you the whore giggle went up an octave you either sister so you vanish okay zone he a close personal friend of mine she looked case in the eye and made the softest possible spitting sound her lips barely moving but she left jesus case said what kind a creep joint you running here man have a drink ha ratz said swabbing the scarred wood with a rag zone shows a percentage you i let work here for entertainment value as case was picking up his beer one of those strange instants of silence descended as though a hundred unrelated conversations had simultaneously arrived at the same pause then the whore giggle rang out tinged with a certain hysteria ratz grunted an angel passed the chinese bellowed a drunken australian chinese bloody invented nerve splicing give me the mainland for a nerve job any day fix you right mate now that case said to his glass all his bitterness suddenly rising in him like bile that is so much bullshit
CH01-P3,CH01,the japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than the chinese had ever known the black clinics of chiba were the cutting edge whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly and still they repair the damage he suffered in that memphis hotel a year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace hope fading nightly all the speed he took all the turns he taken and the corners he cut in night city and still he see the matrix in his sleep bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void the sprawl was a long strange way home over the pacific now and he was no console man no cyberspace cowboy just another hustler trying to make it through but the dreams came on in the japanese night like live wire voodoo and he cry for it cry in his sleep and wake alone in the dark curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel his hands clawed into the bedslab temper foam bunched between his fingers trying to reach the console that there
CH01-P4,CH01,i saw your girl last night ratz said passing case his second kirin i have one he said and drank miss linda lee case shook his head no girl nothing only biz friend artiste dedication to commerce the bartender small brown eyes were nested deep in wrinkled flesh i think i liked you better with her you laughed more now some night you get maybe too artistic you wind up in the clinic tanks spare parts you re breaking my heart ratz he finished his beer paid and left high narrow shoulders hunched beneath the rain stained khaki nylon of his windbreaker threading his way through the ninsei crowds he could smell his own stale sweat case was twenty four at twenty two he been a cowboy a rustler one of the best in the sprawl he been trained by the best by mccoy pauley and bobby quine legends in the biz he operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high a byproduct of youth and proficiency jacked into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the con sensual hallucination that was the matrix a thief he worked for other wealthier thieves employers who provided the exotic software required to penetrate the bright walls of corporate systems opening windows into rich fields of data he made the classic mistake the one he sworn he never make he stole from his employers he kept something for himself and tried to move it through a fence in amsterdam he still sure how he been discovered not that it mattered now he expected to die then but they only smiled
CH01-P5,CH01,of course he was welcome they told him welcome to the money and he was going to need it because still smiling they were going to make sure he never worked again they damaged his nervous system with a wartime russian mycotoxin strapped to a bed in a memphis hotel his talent burning out micron by micron he hallucinated for thirty hours the damage was minute subtle and utterly effective for case who lived for the bodiless exultation of cyberspace it was the fall in the bars he frequented as a cowboy hotshot the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt for the flesh the body was meat case fell into the prison of his own flesh
CH01-P6,CH01,his total assets were quickly converted to new yen a fat sheaf of the old paper currency that circulated endlessly through the closed circuit of the world black markets like the seashells of the trobriand islanders it was difficult to transact legitimate business with cash in the sprawl in japan it was already illegal in japan he known with a clenched and absolute certainty he find his cure in chiba either in a registered clinic or in the shadow land of black medicine synonymous with implants nerve splicing and micro bionics chiba was a magnet for the sprawl techno criminal subcultures in chiba he watched his new yen vanish in a two month round of examinations and consultations the men in the black clinics his last hope had admired the expertise with which he been maimed and then slowly shaken their heads now he slept in the cheapest coffins the ones nearest the port beneath the quartz halogen floods that lit the docks all night like vast stages where you see the lights of tokyo for the glare of the television sky not even the towering hologram logo of the fuji electric company and tokyo bay was a black expanse where gulls wheeled above drifting shoals of white styrofoam behind the port lay the city factory domes dominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies port and city were divided by a narrow borderland of older streets an area with no official name night city with ninsei its heart by day the bars down ninsei were shuttered and featureless the neon dead the holograms inert waiting under the poisoned silver sky
CH01-P7,CH01,two blocks west of the chat in a teashop called the jarre de the case washed down the night first pill with a double espresso it was a flat pink octagon a potent species of brazilian dex he bought from one of zone girls the jarre was walled with mirrors each panel framed in red neon at first finding himself alone in chiba with little money and less hope of finding a cure he gone into a kind of terminal overdrive hustling fresh capital with a cold intensity that had seemed to belong to someone else in the first month he killed two men and a woman over sums that a year before would have seemed ludicrous ninsei wore him down until the street itself came to seem the externalization of some death wish some secret poison he known he carried night city was like a deranged experiment in social darwinism designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast forward button stop hustling and you sank without a trace but move a little too swiftly and you break the fragile surface tension of the black market either way you were gone with nothing left of you but some vague memory in the mind of a fixture like ratz though heart or lungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger with new yen for the clinic tanks biz here was a constant subliminal hum and death the accepted punishment for laziness carelessness lack of grace the failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol alone at a table in the jarre de the with the octagon coming on pinheads of sweat starting from his palms suddenly aware of each tingling hair on his arms and chest case knew that at some point he started to play a game with himself a very ancient one that has no name a final solitaire he no longer carried a weapon no longer took the basic precautions he ran the fastest loosest deals on the street and he had a reputation for being able to get whatever you wanted a part of him knew that the arc of his self destruction was glaringly obvious to his customers who grew steadily fewer but that same part of him basked in the knowledge that it was only a matter of time and that was the part of him smug in its expectation of death that most hated the thought of linda lee he found her one rainy night in an arcade under bright ghosts burning through a blue haze of cigarette smoke holograms of wizard castle tank war europa the new york skyline and now he remembered her that way her face bathed in restless laser light features reduced to a code her cheekbones flaring scarlet as wizard castle burned forehead drenched with azure when munich fell to the tank war mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall of a skyscraper canyon he was riding high that night with a brick of wage ketamine on its way to yokohama and the money already in his pocket he come in out of the warm rain that sizzled across the ninsei pavement and somehow she been singled out for him one face out of the dozens who stood at the consoles lost in the game she played the expression on her face then had been the one he seen hours later on her sleeping face in a port side coffin her upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in flight crossing the arcade to stand beside her high on the deal he made he saw her glance up gray eyes rimmed with smudged black paintstick eyes of some animal pinned in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle their night together stretching into a morning into tickets at the hover port and his first trip across the bay the rain kept up falling along harajuku beading on her plastic jacket the children of tokyo trooping past the famous boutiques in white loafers and cling wrap capes until she stood with him in the midnight clatter of a pachinko parlor and held his hand like a child it took a month for the gestalt of drugs and tension he moved through to turn those perpetually startled eyes into wells of reflexive need he watched her personality fragment calving like an iceberg splinters drifting away and finally he seen the raw need the hungry armature of addiction he watched her track the next hit with a concentration that reminded him of the mantises they sold in stalls along shiga beside tanks of blue mutant carp and crickets caged in bamboo he stared at the black ring of grounds in his empty cup it was vibrating with the speed he taken the brown laminate of the table top was dull with a patina of tiny scratches with the dex mounting through his spine he saw the countless random impacts required to create a surface like that the jarre was decorated in a dated nameless style from the previous century an uneasy blend of japanese traditional and pale milanese plastics but everything seemed to wear a subtle film as though the bad nerves of a million customers had somehow attacked the mirrors and the once glossy plastics leaving each surface fogged with something that could never be wiped away hey case good buddy he looked up met gray eyes ringed with paintstick she was wearing faded french orbital fatigues and new white sneakers
CH01-P8,CH01,i been lookin for you man she took a seat opposite him her elbows on the table the sleeves of the blue zip suit had been ripped out at the shoulders he automatically checked her arms for signs of terms or the needle want a cigarette she dug a crumpled pack of yeheyuan filters from an ankle pocket and offered him one he took it let her light it with a red plastic tube you sleep in okay case you look tired her accent put her south along the sprawl toward atlanta the skin below her eyes was pale and unhealthy looking but the flesh was still smooth and firm she was twenty new lines of pain were starting to etch themselves permanently at the corners of her mouth her dark hair was drawn back held by a band of printed silk the pattern might have represented microcircuits or a city map not if i remember to take my pills he said as a tangible wave of longing hit him lust and loneliness riding in on the wavelength of amphetamine he remembered the smell of her skin in the overheated darkness of a coffin near the port her locked across the small of his back all the meat he thought and all it wants wage she said narrowing her eyes he wants to see you with a hole in your face she lit her own cigarette who says ratz you been talking to ratz no mona her new squeeze is one of wage boys i owe him enough he does me he out the money anyway he shrugged
CH01-P9,CH01,too many people owe him now case maybe you get to be the example you seriously better watch it sure how about you linda you got anywhere to sleep sleep she shook her head sure case she shivered hunched forward over the table her face was filmed with sweat here he said and dug in the pocket of his windbreaker coming up with a crumpled fifty he smoothed it automatically under the table folded it in quarters and passed it to her you need that honey you better give it to wage there was something in the gray eyes now that he read something he never seen there before i owe wage a lot more than that take it i got more coming he lied as he watched his new yen vanish into a zippered pocket you get your money case you find wage quick i ll see you linda he said getting up sure a millimeter of white showed beneath each of her pupils sanpaku you watch your back man he nodded anxious to be gone he looked back as the plastic door swung shut behind him saw her eyes reflected in a cage of red neon
CH01-P10,CH01,friday night on ninsei he passed yakitori stands and massage parlors a franchised coffee shop called beautiful girl the electronic thunder of an arcade he stepped out of the way to let a dark suited sarariman by spotting the mitsubishi genentech logo tattooed across the back of the man right hand was it authentic if that for real he thought he in for trouble if it served him right m g employees above a certain level were implanted with advanced microprocessors that monitored mutagen levels in the bloodstream gear like that would get you rolled in night city rolled straight into a black clinic the sarariman had been japanese but the ninsei crowd was a gaijin crowd groups of sailors up from the port tense solitary tourists hunting pleasures no guidebook listed sprawl heavies showing off grafts and implants and a dozen distinct species of hustler all swarming the street in an intricate dance of desire and commerce there were countless theories explaining why chiba city tolerated the ninsei enclave but case tended toward the idea that the yakuza might be preserving the place as a kind of historical park a reminder of humble origins but he also saw a certain sense in the notion that burgeoning technologies require outlaw zones that night city there for its inhabitants but as a deliberately unsupervised playground for technology itself was linda right he wondered staring up at the lights would wage have him killed to make an example it make much sense but then wage dealt primarily in proscribed biologicals and they said you had to be crazy to do that but linda said wage wanted him dead case primary insight into the dynamics of street dealing was that neither the buyer nor the seller really needed him a middleman business is to make himself a necessary evil the dubious niche case had carved for himself in the criminal ecology of night city had beep cut out with lies scooped out a night at a time with betrayal now sensing that its walls were starting to crumble he felt the edge of a strange euphoria the week before he delayed transfer of a synthetic glandular extract retailing it for a wider margin than usual he knew wage liked that wage was his primary supplier nine years in chiba and one of the few gaijin dealers who managed to forge links with the rigidly stratified criminal establishment beyond night city borders genetic materials and hormones trickled down to ninsei along an intricate ladder of fronts and blinds somehow wage had managed to trace something back once and now he enjoyed steady connections in a dozen cities case found himself staring through a shop window the place sold small bright objects to the sailors watches flicknives lighters pocket vtrs sims tim decks weighted man riki chains and shuriken the shuriken had always fascinated him steel stars with knife sharp points some were chromed others black others treated with a rainbow surface like oil on water but the chrome stars held his gaze they were mounted against scarlet ultra suede with nearly invisible loops of nylon fish line their centers stamped with dragons or yin yang symbols they caught the street neon and twisted it and it came to case that these were the stars under which he voyaged his destiny spelled out in a constellation of cheap chrome julie he said to his stars time to see old julie he ll know
CH01-P11,CH01,julius deane was one hundred and thirty five years old his metabolism assiduously warped by a weekly fortune in serums and hormones his primary hedge against aging was a yearly pilgrimage to tokyo where genetic surgeons re set the code of his dna a procedure unavailable in chiba then he fly to hong kong and order the year suits and shirts sex less and inhumanly patient his primary gratification seemed to lie in his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor worship case had never seen him wear the same suit twice although his wardrobe seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstructions of garments of the previous century he affected prescription lenses framed in spidery gold ground from thin slabs of pink synthetic quartz and beveled like the mirrors in a victorian doll house his offices were located in a warehouse behind ninsei part of which seemed to have been sparsely decorated years before with a random collection of european furniture as though deane had once intended to use the place as his home neo aztec bookcases gathered dust against one wall of the room where case waited a pair of bulbous disney styled table lamps perched awkwardly on a low kandinsky look coffee table in scarlet lacquered steel a dali clock hung on the wall between the bookcases its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete floor its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the face as they rotated but it never told the correct time the room was stacked with white fiberglass shipping modules that gave off the tang of preserved ginger you seem to be clean old son said deane disembodied voice do come in magnetic bolts thudded out of position around the massive imitation rosewood door to the left of the bookcases julius deane import export was lettered across the plastic in peeling self adhesive capitals if the furniture scattered in deane makeshift foyer suggested the end of the past century the office itself seemed to belong to its start deane seamless pink face regarded case from a pool of light cast by an ancient brass lamp with a rectangular shade of dark green glass the importer was securely fenced behind a vast desk of painted steel flanked on either side by tall drawer ed cabinets made of some sort of pale wood the sort of thing case supposed that had once been used to store written records of some kind the desktop was littered with cassettes scrolls of yellowed printout and various parts of some sort of clockwork typewriter a machine deane never seemed to get around to reassembling what brings you around boy deane asked offering case a narrow bonbon wrapped in blue and white checked paper try one tins ting djahe the very best case refused the ginger took a seat in a yawing wooden swivel chair and ran a thumb down the faded seam of one black jeans leg julie i hear wage wants to kill me ah well then and where did you hear this if i may people people deane said around a ginger bonbon what sort of people friends case nodded not always that easy to know who your friends are is it i do owe him a little money deane he say anything to you been in touch of late then he sighed if i did know of course i might not be in a position to tell you things being what they are you understand things he an important connection case yeah he want to kill me julie not that i know of deane shrugged they might have been discussing the price of ginger if it proves to be an unfounded rumor old son you come back in a week or so and i ll let you in on a little something out of singapore out of the nan hai hotel bencoolen street loose lips old son deane grinned the steel desk was jammed with a fortune in debugging gear be seeing you julie i ll say hello to wage
CH01-P12,CH01,deane fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in his pale silk tie
CH01-P13,CH01,he was less than a block from deane office when it hit the sudden cellular awareness that someone was on his ass and very close the cultivation of a certain tame paranoia was something case took for granted the trick lay in not letting it get out of control but that could be quite a trick behind a stack of octagons he fought the adrenaline surge and composed his narrow features in a mask of bored vacancy pretending to let the crowd carry him along when he saw a darkened display window he managed to pause by it the place was a surgical boutique closed for renovations with his hands in the pockets of his jacket he stared through the glass at a flat lozenge of vat grown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade the color of its skin reminded him of zone whores it was tattooed with a luminous digital display wired to a sub cutaneous chip why bother with the surgery he found himself thinking while sweat coursed down his ribs when you could just carry the thing around in your pocket without moving his head he raised his eyes and studied the reflection of the passing crowd there behind sailors in short sleeved khaki dark hair mirrored glasses dark clothing slender and gone then case was running bent low dodging between bodies
CH01-P14,CH01,rent me a gun shin the boy smiled two hour they stood together in the smell of fresh raw seafood at the rear of a shiga sushi stall you come back two hour i need one now man got anything right now shin rummaged behind empty two liter cans that had once been filled with powdered horseradish he produced a slender package wrapped in gray plastic taser one hour twenty new yen thirty deposit shit i need that i need a gun like i maybe wanna shoot somebody understand the waiter shrugged replacing the taser behind the horseradish cans two hour he went into the shop without bothering to glance at the display of shuriken he never thrown one in his life he bought two packs of yeheyuans with a mitsubishi bank chip that gave his name as charles derek may it beat truman starr the best he been able to do for a passport the japanese woman behind the terminal looked like she had a few years on old deane none of them with the benefit of science he took his slender roll of new yen out of his pocket and showed it to her i want to buy a weapon she gestured in the direction of a case filled with knives no he said i like knives she brought an oblong box from beneath the counter the lid was yellow cardboard stamped with a crude image of a coiled cobra with a swollen hood inside were eight identical tissue wrapped cylinders he watched while mottled brown fingers stripped the paper from one she held the thing up for him to examine a dull steel tube with a leather thong at one end and a small bronze pyramid at the other she gripped the tube with one hand the pyramid between her other thumb and forefinger and pulled three oiled telescoping segments of tightly wound coil spring slid out and locked cobra she said
CH01-P15,CH01,beyond the neon shudder of ninsei the sky was that mean shade of gray the air had gotten worse it seemed to have teeth tonight and half the crowd wore filtration masks case had spent ten minutes in a urinal trying to discover a convenient way to conceal his cobra finally he settled for tucking the handle into the waistband of his jeans with the tube slanting across his stomach the pyramidal striking tip rode between his ribcage and the lining of his windbreaker the thing felt like it might clatter to the pavement with his next step but it made him feel better the chat really a dealing bar but on weeknights it attracted a related clientele fridays and saturdays were different the regulars were still there most of them but they faded behind an influx of sailors and the specialists who preyed on diem as case pushed through the doors he looked for ratz but the bartender in sight lonny zone the bar resident pimp was observing with glazed fatherly interest as one of his girls went to work on a young sailor zone was addicted to a brand of hypnotic the japanese called cloud dancers catching the pimp eye case beckoned him to the bar zone came drifting through the crowd in slow motion his long face slack and placid you seen wage tonight lonny zone regarded him with his usual calm he shook his head you sure man maybe in the namban maybe two hours ago got some joeboys with him one of em thin dark hair maybe a black jacket no zone said at last his smooth forehead creased to indicate the effort it cost him to recall so much pointless detail big boys graftees zone eyes showed very little white and less iris under the drooping lids his pupils were dilated and enormous he stared into case face for a long time then lowered his gaze he saw the bulge of the steel whip cobra he said and raised an eyebrow you wanna fuck somebody up see you lonny case left the bar
CH01-P16,CH01,his tail was back he was sure of it he felt a stab of elation the octagons and adrenaline mingling with something else you re enjoying this he thought you re crazy because in some weird and very approximate way it was like a run in the matrix get just wasted enough find yourself in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble and it was possible to see ninsei as a field of data the way the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialties then you could throw yourself into a high speed drift and skid totally engaged but set apart from it all and all around you the dance of biz information interacting data made flesh in the mazes of the black market go it case he told himself suck em in last thing they ll expect he was half a block from the games arcade where he first met linda lee he bolted across ninsei scattering a pack of strolling sailors one of them screamed after him in spanish then he was through the entrance the sound crashing over him like surf subsonics throbbing in the pit of his stomach someone scored a ten megaton hit on tank war europa a simulated air burst drowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball mushroomed overhead he cut to the right and loped up a flight of unpainted chip board stairs he come here once with wage to discuss a deal in proscribed hormonal triggers with a man called matsuga he remembered the hallway its stained matting the row of identical doors leading to tiny office cubicles one door was open now a japanese girl in a sleeveless black t shirt glanced up from a white terminal behind her head a travel poster of greece aegian blue splashed with streamlined ideograms get your security up here case told her then he sprinted down the corridor out of her sight the last two doors were closed and he assumed locked he spun and slammed the sole of his nylon running shoe into the blue lacquered composition door at the far end it popped cheap hardware falling from the splintered frame darkness there the white curve of a terminal housing then he was on the door to its right both hands around the transparent plastic knob leaning in with everything he had something snapped and he was inside this was where he and wage had met with matsuga but whatever front company matsuga had operated was long gone no terminal nothing light from the alley behind the arcade filtering in through soot blown plastic he made out a snake like loop of fiber optics protruding from a wall socket a pile of discarded food containers and the blade less nacelle of an electric fan the window was a single pane of cheap plastic he shrugged out of his jacket bundled it around his right hand and punched it split requiring two more blows to free it from the frame over the muted chaos of the games an alarm began to cycle triggered either by the broken window or by the girl at the head of the corridor case turned pulled his jacket on and flicked the cobra to full extension with the door closed he was counting on his tail to assume he gone through the one he kicked half off its hinges the cobra bronze pyramid began to bob gently the spring steel shaft amplifying his pulse nothing happened there was only the surging of the alarm the crashing of the games his heart hammering when the fear came it was like some half forgotten friend not the cold rapid mechanism of the dex paranoia but simple animal fear he lived for so long on a constant edge of anxiety that he almost forgotten what real fear was this cubicle was the sort of place where people died he might die here they might have guns a crash from the far end of the corridor a man voice shouting something in japanese a scream shrill terror another crash and footsteps unhurried coming closer passing his closed door pausing for the space of three rapid beats of his heart and returning one two three a bootheel scraped the matting the last of his octagon induced bravado collapsed he snapped the cobra into its handle and scrambled for the window blind with fear his nerves screaming he was up out and falling all before he was conscious of what he done the impact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins a narrow wedge of light from a half open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a junked console he fallen face forward on a slab of soggy chip board he rolled over into the shadow of the console the cubicle window was a square of faint light the alarm still oscillated louder here the rear wall dulling the roar of the games a head appeared framed in the window back lit by the fluorescents in the corridor then vanished it returned but he still read the features glint of silver across the eyes shit someone said a woman in the accent of the northern sprawl the head was gone case lay under the console for a long count of twenty then stood up the steel cobra was still in his hand and it took him a few seconds to remember what it was he limped away down the alley nursing his left ankle
CH01-P17,CH01,shin pistol was a fifty year old vietnamese imitation of a south american copy of a walther ppk double action on the first shot with a very rough pull it was chambered for long rifle and case would ve preferred lead azide explosives to the simple chinese hollow points shin had sold him still it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition and as he made his way down shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket the grips were bright red plastic molded in a raised dragon motif something to run your thumb across in the dark he consigned the cobra to a dump canister on ninsei and dry swallowed another octagon the pill lit his circuits and he rode the rush down shiga to ninsei then over to baiitsu his tail he decided was gone and that was fine he had calls to make biz to transact and it wait a block down baiitsu toward the port stood a featureless ten story office building in ugly yellow brick its windows were dark now but a faint glow from the roof was visible if you craned your neck an unlit neon sign near the main entrance offered cheap hotel under a cluster of ideograms if the place had another name case know it it was always referred to as cheap hotel you reached it through an alley off baiitsu where an elevator waited at the foot of a transparent shaft the elevator like cheap hotel was an afterthought lashed to the building with bamboo and epoxy case climbed into the plastic cage and used his key an unmarked length of rigid magnetic tape case had rented a coffin here on a weekly basis since he arrived in chiba but he never slept in cheap hotel he slept in cheaper places the elevator smelled of perfume and cigarettes the sides of the cage was scratched and thumb smudged as it passed the fifth floor he saw the lights of ninsei he drummed his fingers against the pistol grip as the cage slowed with a gradual hiss as always it came to a full stop with a violent jolt but he was ready for it he stepped out into the courtyard that served the place as some combination of lobby and lawn centered in the square carpet of green plastic turf a lapanese teenager sat behind a c shaped console reading a textbook the white fiberglass coffins were racked in a framework of industrial scaffolding six tiers of coffins ten coffins on a side

CH02-P42,CH02,summer in the sprawl the mall crowds swaying like wind blown grass a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification he sat beside molly in filtered sunlight on the rim of a dry concrete fountain letting the endless stream of faces recapitulate the stages of his life first a child with hooded eyes a street boy hands relaxed and ready at his sides then a teenager face smooth and cryptic beneath red glasses case remembered fighting on a rooftop at seventeen silent combat in the rose glow of the dawn geodesics he shifted on the concrete feeling it rough and cool through the thin black denim nothing here like the electric dance of ninsei this was different commerce a different rhythm in the smell of fast food and perfume and fresh summer sweat with his deck waiting back in the loft an ono sendai cyberspace they left the place littered with the abstract white forms of the foam packing units with crumpled plastic film and hundreds of tiny foam beads the ono sendai next year most expensive hosaka computer a sony monitor a dozen disks of corporate grade ice a braun coffee maker armitage had only waited for case approval of each piece where he go case had asked molly he likes hotels big ones near airports if he can manage it let go down to the street she zipped herself into an old surplus vest with a dozen oddly shaped pockets and put on a huge pair of black plastic sunglasses that completely covered her mirrored insets you know about that toxin shit before he asked her by the fountain she shook her head you think it true maybe maybe not works either way you know any way i can find out no she said her right hand coming up to form the jive for silence that kind of kink too subtle to show up on a scan then her fingers moved again wait and you care that much anyway i saw you stroking that sendai man it was pornographic she laughed so what he got on you how he got the working girl kinked professional pride baby that all and again the sign for silence we re gonna get some breakfast okay eggs real bacon probably kill you you been eating that rebuilt chiba krill for so long yeah come on we ll tube in to manhattan and get us a real breakfast
CH02-P43,CH02,lifeless neon spelled out metro holografix in dusty capitals of glass tubing case picked at a shred of bacon that had lodged between his front teeth he given up asking her where they were going and why jabs in the ribs and the sign for silence were all he gotten in reply she talked about the season fashions about sports about a political scandal in california he never heard of he looked around the deserted dead end street a sheet of newsprint went cart wheeling past the intersection freak winds in the east side something to do with convection and an overlap in the domes case peered through the window at the dead sign her sprawl his sprawl he decided she led him through a dozen bars and clubs he never seen before taking care of business usually with no more than a nod maintaining connections something was moving in the shadows behind metro holografix the door was a sheet of corrugated roofing in front of it molly hands flowed through an intricate sequence of jive that he follow he caught the sign for cash a thumb brushing the tip of the forefinger the door swung inward and sheled him into the smell of dust they stood in a clearing dense tangles of junk rising on either side to walls lined with shelves of crumbling paperbacks the junk looked like something that had grown there a fungus of twisted metal and plastic he could pick out individual objects but then they seemed to blur back into the mass the guts of a television so old it was studded with the glass stumps of vacuum tubes a crumpled dish antenna a brown fiber canister stuffed with corroded lengths of alloy tubing an enormous pile of old magazines had cascaded into the open area flesh of lost summers staring blindly up as he followed her back through a narrow canyon of impacted scrap he heard the door close behind them he look back
CH02-P44,CH02,the tunnel ended with an ancient army blanket tacked across a doorway white light flooded out as molly ducked past it four square walls of blank white plastic ceiling to match floored with white hospital tile molded in a non slip pattern of small raised disks in the center stood a square white painted wooden table and four white folding chairs the man who stood blinking now in the doorway behind them the blanket draping one shoulder like a cape seemed to have been designed in a wind tunnel his ears were very small plastered flat against his narrow skull and his large front teeth revealed in something that quite a smile were canted sharply backward he wore an ancient tweed jacket and held a handgun of some kind in his left hand he peered at them blinked and dropped the gun into a jacket pocket he gestured to case pointed at a slab of white plastic that leaned near the doorway case crossed to it and saw that it was a solid sandwich of circuitry nearly a centimeter thick he helped the man lift it and position it in the doorway quick nicotine stained fingers secured it with a white velcro border a hidden exhaust fan began to purr time the man said straightening

CH02-P49,CH02,molly was gone when he took the trodes off and the loft was dark he checked the time he been in cyberspace for five hours he carried the ono sendai to one of the new worktables and collapsed across the bedslab pulling molly black silk sleeping bag over his head the security package taped to the steel fire door bleeped twice entry requested it said subject is cleared per my program so open it case pulled the silk from his face and sat up as the door opened expecting to see molly or armitage christ said a hoarse voice i know that bitch can see in the dark a squat figure stepped in and closed the door turn the lights on okay case scrambled off the slab and found the old fashioned switch i the finn said the finn and made a warning face at case case pleased to meecha i sure i doing some hardware for your boss it looks like the finn fished a pack of partagas from a pocket and lit one the smell of cuban tobacco filled the room he crossed to the worktable and glanced at the ono sendai looks stock soon fix that but here is your problem kid he took a filthy manila envelope from inside his jacket flicked ash on the floor and extracted a featureless black rectangle from the envelope goddamn factory prototypes he said tossing the thing down on the table cast em into a block of polycarbon get in with a laser without frying the works booby trapped for x ray ultrascan god knows what else we ll get in but there no rest for the wicked right he folded the envelope with great care and tucked it away in an inside pocket what is it it a flip flop switch basically wire it into your sendai here you can access live or recorded sims tim without having to jack out of the matrix what for i got a clue know i fitting moll for a broadcast rig though so it probably her sensorium you ll access the finn scratched his chin so now you get to find out just how tight those jeans really are huh
CH02-P50,CH02,case sat in the loft with the dermatrodes strapped across his forehead watching motes dance in the diluted sunlight that filtered through the grid overhead a countdown was in progress in one corner of the monitor screen cowboys get into simstim he thought because it was basically a meat toy he knew that the trodes he used and the little plastic tiara dangling from a simstim deck were basically the same and that the cyberspace matrix was actually a drastic simplification of the human sensorium at least in terms of presentation but simstim itself struck him as a gratuitous multiplication of flesh input the commercial stuff was edited of course so that if tally isham got a headache in the course of a segment you feel it the screen bleeped a two second warning the new switch was patched into his sendai with a thin ribbon of fiber optics and one and two and

CH02-P55,CH02,case met his first modern two days after he screened the hosaka precis the moderns he decided were a contemporary version of the big scientists of his own late teens there was a kind of ghostly teenage dna at work in the sprawl something that carried the coded precepts of various short lived sub cults and replicated them at odd intervals the panther moderns were a soft head variant on the scientists if the technology had been available the big scientists would all have had sockets stuffed with microsofts it was the style that mattered and the style was the same the moderns were mercenaries practical jokers nihilistic technofetishists the one who showed up at the loft door with a box of diskettes from the finn was a soft voiced boy called angelo his face was a simple graft grown on collagen and shark cartilage polysaccharides smooth and hideous it was one of the nastiest pieces of elective surgery case had ever seen when angelo smiled revealing the razor sharp canines of some large animal case was actually relieved tooth bud transplants he seen that before you let the little pricks generation gap you molly said case nodded absorbed in the patterns of the sense net ice this was it this was what he was who he was his being he forgot to eat molly left cartons of rice and foam trays of sushi on the corner of the long table sometimes he resented having to leave the deck to use the chemical toilet they set up in a corner of the loft ice patterns formed and reformed on the screen as he probed for gaps skirted the most obvious traps and mapped the route he take through sense net ice it was good ice wonderful ice its patterns burned there while he lay with his arm under molly shoulders watching the red dawn through the steel grid of the skylight its rainbow pixel maze was the first thing he saw when he woke he go straight to the deck not bothering to dress and jack in he was cutting it he was working he lost track of days and sometimes falling asleep particularly when molly was off on one of her reconnaissance trips with her rented cadre of moderns images of chiba came flooding back faces and ninsei neon once he woke from a confused dream of linda lee unable to recall who she was or what she ever meant to him when he did remember he jacked in and worked for nine straight hours the cutting of sense net ice took a total of nine days i said a week armitage said unable to conceal his satisfaction when case showed him his plan for the run you took your own good time balls case said smiling at the screen that good work armitage yes armitage admitted but let it go to your head compared to what you ll eventually be up against this is an arcade toy
CH02-P56,CH02,love you cat mother whispered the panther modern link man his voice was modulated static in case headset atlanta brood looks go go got it molly voice was slightly clearer to hear is to obey the moderns were using some kind of chicken wire dish in new jersey to bounce the link man scrambled signal off a sons of christ the king satellite in geosynchronous orbit above manhattan they chose to regard the entire operation as an elaborate private joke and their choice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate molly signals were being beamed up from a one meter umbrella dish epoxy ed to the roof of a black glass bank tower nearly as tall as the sense net building atlanta the recognition code was simple atlanta to boston to chicago to denver five minutes for each city if anyone managed to intercept molly signal unscramble it synth her voice the code would tip the moderns if she remained in the building for more than twenty minutes it was highly unlikely she be coming out at all case gulped the last of his coffee settled the trodes in place and scratched his chest beneath his black t shirt he had only a vague idea of what the panther moderns planned as a diversion for the sense net security people his job was to make sure the intrusion program he written would link with the sense net systems when molly needed it to he watched the countdown in the corner of the screen two one he jacked in and triggered his program mainline breathed the link man his voice the only sound as case plunged through the glowing strata of sense net ice good check molly he hit the simstim and flipped into her sensorium the scrambler blurred the visual input slightly she stood before a wall of gold flecked mirror in the building vast white lobby chewing gum apparently fascinated by her own reflection aside from the huge pair of sunglasses concealing her mirrored insets she managed to look remarkably like she belonged there another tourist girl hoping for a glimpse of tally isham she wore a pink plastic raincoat a white mesh top loose white pants cut in a style that had been fashionable in tokyo the previous year she grinned vacantly and popped her gum case felt like laughing he could feel the micro pore tape across her ribcage feel the flat little units under it the radio the simstim unit and the scrambler the throat mike glued to her neck looked as much as possible like an analgesic dermadisk her hands in the pockets of the pink coat were flexing systematically through a series of tension release exercises it took him a few seconds to realize that the peculiar sensation at the tips of her fingers was caused by the blades as they were partially extruded then retracted he flipped back his program had reached the fifth gate he watched as his icebreaker strobed and shifted in front of him only faintly aware of his hands playing across the deck making minor adjustments translucent planes of color shuffled like a trick deck take a card he thought any card the gate blurred past he laughed the sense net ice had accepted his entry as a routine transfer from the consortium los angeles complex he was inside behind him viral subprograms peeled off meshing with the gate s code fabric ready to deflect the real los angeles data when it arrived he flipped again molly was strolling past the enormous circular reception desk at the rear of the lobby as the readout flared in her optic nerve at midnight synch ed with the chip behind molly eye the link man in jersey had given his command mainline nine moderns scattered along two hundred miles of the sprawl had simultaneously dialed max emerg from pay phones each modern delivered a short set speech hung up and drifted out into the night peeling off surgical gloves nine different police departments and public security agencies were absorbing the information that an obscure sub sect of militant christian fundamentalists had just taken credit for having introduced clinical levels of an outlawed psychoactive agent known as blue nine into the ventilation system of the sense net pyramid blue nine known in california as grievous angel had been shown to produce acute paranoia and homicidal psychosis in eighty five percent of experimental subjects
CH02-P57,CH02,case hit the switch as his program surged through the gates of the subsystem that controlled security for the sense net research library he found himself stepping into an elevator excuse me but are you an employee the guard raised his eyebrows molly popped her gum no she said driving the first two knuckles of her right hand into the man solar plexus as he doubled over clawing for the beeper on his belt she slammed his head sideways against the wall of the elevator chewing a little more rapidly now she touched close door and stop on the illuminated panel she took a black box from her coat pocket and inserted a lead in the keyhole of the lock that secured the panel circuitry
CH02-P58,CH02,the panther moderns allowed four minutes for their first move to take effect then injected a second carefully prepared dose of misinformation this time they shot it directly into the sense net building internal video system at every screen in the building strobed for eighteen seconds in a frequency that produced seizures in a susceptible segment of sense net employees then something only vaguely like a human face filled the screens its features stretched across asymmetrical expanses of bone like some obscene mercator projection blue lips parted wetly as the twisted elongated jaw moved something perhaps a hand a thing like a reddish clump of gnarled roots fumbled toward the camera blurred and vanished subliminally rapid images of contamination graphics of the building water supply system gloved hands manipulating laboratory glassware something tumbling down into darkness a pale splash the audio track its pitch adjusted to run at just less than twice the standard playback speed was part of a month old newscast detailing potential military uses of a substance known as hsg a biochemical governing the human skeletal growth factor overdoses of hsg threw certain bone cells into overdrive accelerating growth by factors as high as one thousand percent at the mirror sheathed nexus of the sense net consortium held just over three thousand employees at five minutes after midnight as the moderns message ended in a flare of white screen the sense net pyramid screamed half a dozen nypd tactical hovercraft responding to the possibility of blue nine in the building ventilation system were converging on the sense net pyramid they were running full riot lights a bama rapid deployment helicopter was lifting off from its pad on riker
CH02-P59,CH02,case triggered his second program a carefully engineered virus attacked the code fabric screening primary custodial commands for the sub basement that housed the sense net research materials boston molly voice came across the link i downstairs case switched and saw the blank wall of the elevator she was unzipping the white pants a bulky packet exactly the shade of her pale ankle was secured there with micro pore she knelt and peeled the tape away streaks of burgundy flickered across the mimetic polycarbon as she unfolded the modern suit she removed the pink raincoat threw it down beside the white pants and began to pull the suit on over the white mesh top case virus had bored a window through the library command ice he punched himself through and found an infinite blue space ranged with color coded spheres strung on a tight grid of pale blue neon in the non space of the matrix the interior of a given data construct possessed unlimited subjective dimension a child toy calculator accessed through case sendai would have presented limitless gulfs of nothingness hung with a few basic commands case began to key the sequence the finn had purchased from a mid eschelon sarariman with severe drug problems he began to glide through the spheres as if he were on invisible tracks here this one punching his way into the sphere chill blue neon vault above him starless and smooth as frosted glass he triggered a sub program that effected certain alterations in the core custodial commands out now reversing smoothly the virus reknitting the fabric of the window done

CH02-P61,CH02,case hit the sim stim switch and flipped into the agony of broken bone molly was braced against the blank gray wall of a long corridor her breath coming ragged and uneven case was back in the matrix instantly a white hot line of pain fading in his left thigh what happening brood he asked the link man i dunno cutter mother not talking wait case program was cycling a single hair fine thread of crimson neon extended from the center of the restored window to the shifting outline of his icebreaker he have time to wait taking a deep breath he flipped again molly took a single step trying to support her weight on the corridor wall in the loft case groaned the second step took her over an outstretched arm uniform sleeve bright with fresh blood glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shock stave her vision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel with the third step case screamed and found himself back in the matrix brood boston baby her voice tight with pain she coughed little problem with the natives think one of them broke my leg what you need now cat mother the link man voice was indistinct nearly lost behind static case forced himself to flip back she was leaning against the wall taking all of her weight on her right leg she fumbled through the contents of the suit kangaroo pocket and withdrew a sheet of plastic studded with a rainbow of dermadisks she selected three and thumbed them hard against her left wrist over the veins six thousand micrograms of endorphin analog came down on the pain like a hammer shattering it her back arched convulsively pink waves of warmth lapped up her thighs she sighed and slowly relaxed okay brood okay now but i ll need a medical team when l come out tell my people cutter i two minutes from target can you hold tell her i in and holding case said molly began to limp down the corridor when she glanced back once case saw the crumpled bodies of three sense net security guards one of them seemed to have no eyes tacticals and rapids have sealed the ground floor cat mother foam barricades lobby getting juicy pretty juicy down here she said swinging herself through a pair of gray steel doors almost there cutter case flipped into the matrix and pulled the trodes from his forehead he was drenched with sweat he wiped his forehead with a towel took a quick sip of water from the bicycle bottle beside the hosaka and checked the map of the library displayed on the screen a pulsing red cursor crept through the outline of a doorway only millimeters from the green dot that indicated the location of the dixie flat line construct he wondered what it was doing to her leg to walk on it that way with enough endorphin analog she could walk on a pair of bloody stumps he tightened the nylon harness that held him in the chair and replaced the trodes routine now trodes jack and flip the sense net research library was a dead storage area the materials stored here had to be physically removed before they could be interfaced molly hobbled between rows of identical gray lockers tell her five more and ten to her left brood case said five more and ten left cat mother the link man said she took the left a white faced librarian cowered between two lockers her cheeks wet eyes blank molly ignored her case wondered what the moderns had done to provoke that level of terror he knew it had something to do with a hoaxed threat but he d been too involved with his ice to follow molly s explanation that it case said but she already stopped in front of the cabinet that held the construct its lines reminded case of the neo aztec bookcases in julie deane anteroom in chiba do it cutter molly said case flipped to cyberspace and sent a command pulsing down the crimson thread that pierced the library ice five separate alarm systems were convinced that they were still operative the three elaborate locks deactivated but considered themselves to have remained locked the library central bank suffered a minute shift in its permanent memory the construct had been removed per executive order a month before checking for the authorization to remove the construct a librarian would find the records erased the door swung open on silent hinges case said and molly drew a black storage unit from the rack it resembled the magazine of a large assault rifle its surfaces covered with warning decals and security ratings molly closed the locker door case flipped he withdrew the line through the library ice it whipped back into his program automatically triggering a full system reversal the sense net gates snapped past him as he backed out subprograms whirling back into the core of the icebreaker as he passed the gates where they had been stationed out brood he said and slumped in his chair after the concentration of an actual run he could remain jacked in and still retain awareness of his body it might take sense net days to discover the theft of the construct the key would be the deflection of the los angeles transfer which coincided too neatly with the modern terror run he doubted that the three security men molly had encountered in the corridor would live to talk about it he flipped the elevator with molly black box taped beside the control panel remained where she left it the guard still lay curled on the floor case noticed the term on his neck for the first time something of molly to keep him under she stepped over him and removed the black box before punching lobby as the elevator door hissed open a woman hurtled backward out of the crowd into the elevator and struck the rear wall with her head molly ignored her bending over to peel the derm from the guard neck then she kicked the white pants and the pink raincoat out the door tossing the dark glasses after them and drew the hood of her suit down across her forehead the construct in the suit kangaroo pocket dug into her sternum when she moved she stepped out
CH02-P62,CH02,case had seen panic before but never in an enclosed area the sense net employees spilling out of the elevators had surged for the street doors only to meet the foam barricades of the tacticals and the sandbag guns of the bama rapids the two agencies convinced that they were containing a horde of potential killers were cooperating with an uncharacteristic degree of efficiency beyond the shattered wreckage of the main street doors bodies were piled three deep on the barricades the hollow thumping of the riot guns provided a constant background for the sound the crowd made as it surged back and forth across the lobby marble floor case had never heard anything like that sound neither apparently had molly jesus she said and hesitated it was a sort of keening rising into a bubbling wail of mw and total fear the lobby floor was covered with bodies clothing blood and long trampled scrolls of yellow printout c on sister we re for out the eyes of the two moderns stared out of madly swirling shades of polycarbon their suits unable to keep up with the confusion of shape and color that raged behind them you hurt c on tommy ll walk you tommy handed something to the one who spoke a video camera wrapped in polycarbon chicago she said i on my way and then she was falling not to the marble floor slick with blood and vomit but down some blood warm well into silence and the dark
CH02-P63,CH02,the panther modern leader who introduced himself as lupus yonderboy wore a polycarbon suit with a recording feature that allowed him to replay backgrounds at will perched on the edge of case worktable like some kind of state of the art gargoyle he regarded case and armitage with hooded eyes he smiled his hair was pink a rainbow forest of microsofts bristled behind his left ear the ear was pointed tufted with more pink hair his pupils had been modified to catch the light like a cat case watched the suit crawl with color and texture you let it getout of control armitage said he stood in the center of the loft like a statue wrapped in the dark glossy folds of an expensive looking trench coat chaos mr who lupus yonderboy said that is our mode and modus that is our central kick your woman knows we deal with her not with you mr who his suit had taken on a weird angular pattern of beige and pale avocado she needed her medical team she with them we ll watch out for her everything fine he smiled again pay him case said armitage glared at him we have the goods your woman has it yonderboy said pay him armitage crossed stiffly to the table and took three fat bundles of new yen from the pockets of his trench coat you want to count it he asked yonder boy no the panther modern said you ll pay you re a mr who you pay to stay one not a mr name i hope that a threat armitage said that business said yonderboy stuffing the money into the single pocket on the front of his suit the phone rang case answered molly he told armitage handing him the phone
CH02-P64,CH02,the sprawl geodesics were lightening into predawn gray as case left the building his limbs felt cold and disconnected he sleep he was sick of the loft lupus had gone then armitage and molly was in surgery somewhere vibration beneath his feet as a train hissed past sirens doppler ed in the distance he took corners at random his collar up hunched in a new leather jacket flicking the first of a chain of yeheyuans into the gutter and lighting another he tried to imagine armitage toxin sacs dissolving in his bloodstream microscopic membranes wearing thinner as he walked it seem real neither did the fear and agony he seen through molly eyes in the lobby of sense net he found himself trying to remember the faces of the three people he killed in chiba the men were blanks the woman reminded him of linda lee a battered tricycle truck with mirrored windows bounced past him empty plastic cylinders rattling in its bed case he darted sideways instinctively getting a wall behind his back message for you case lupus yonder boy suit cycled through pure primaries pardon not to startle you case straightened up hands in jacket pockets he was a head taller than the modern you ought a be careful yonder boy this is the message winter mute he spelled it out from you case took a step forward no yonderboy said for you who from winter mute yonderboy repeated nodding bobbing his crest of pink hair his suit went matte black a carbon shadow against old concrete he executed a strange little dance his thin black arms whirling and then he was gone no there hood up to hide the pink the suit exactly the right shade of gray mottled and stained as the sidewalk he stood on the eyes winked back the red of a stoplight and then he was really gone case closed his eyes massaged them with numb fingers leaning back against peeling brickwork ninsei had been a lot simpler
CH02-P65,CH02,the medical team molly employed occupied two floors of an anonymous condo rack near the old hub of baltimore the building was modular like some giant version of cheap hotel each coffin forty meters long case met molly as she emerged from one that wore the elaborately worked logo of one gerald chin dentist she was limping he says if i kick anything it ll fall off i ran into one of your pals he said a modern yeah which one lupus yonderboy had a message he passed her a paper napkin with w i n t e r m u t e printed in red feltpen in his neat laborious capitals he said but her hand came up in the jive for silence get us some crab she said
CH02-P66,CH02,after lunch in baltimore molly dissecting her crab with alarming ease they tubed in to new york case had learned not to ask questions they only brought the sign for silence her leg seemed to be bothering her and she seldom spoke a thin black child with wooden beads and antique resistors woven tightly into her hair opened the finn door and led them along the tunnel of refuse case felt the stuff had grown somehow during their absence or else it seemed that it was changing subtly cooking itself down under the pressure of time silent invisible flakes settling to form a mulch a crystalline essence of discarded technology flowering secretly in the sprawl waste places beyond the army blanket the finn waited at the white table molly began to sign rapidly produced a scrap of paper wrote something on it and passed it to the finn he took it between thumb and forefinger holding it away from his body as though it might explode he made a sign case know one that conveyed a mixture of impatience and glum resignation he stood up brushing crumbs from the front of his battered tweed jacket a glass jar of pickled herring stood on the table beside a torn plastic package of flatbread and a tin ashtray piled with the butts of partagas wait the finn said and left the room molly took his place extruded the blade from her index finger and speared a grayish slab of herring case wandered aimlessly around the room fingering the scanning gear on the pylons as he passed ten minutes and the finn came bustling back showing his teeth in a wide yellow smile he nodded gave molly a thumbs up salute and gestured to case to help him with the door panel while case smoothed the velcro border into place the finn took a flat little console from his pocket and punched out an elaborate sequence honey he said to molly tucking the console away you have got it no shit i can smell it you wanna tell me where you got it yonderboy molly said shoving the herring and crackers aside i did a deal with larry on the side smart the finn said it an ai slow it down a little case said berne the finn said ignoring him berne it got limited swiss citizenship under their equivalent of the act of built for tessier ashpool s a they own the mainframe and the original software what in beme okay case deliberately stepped between them wintermute is the recognition code for an ai i ve got the turing registry numbers artificial intelligence that all just fine molly said but where it get us if yonderboy right the finn said this al is backing armitage i paid larry to have the moderns nose around ammitage a little molly explained turning to case they have some very weird lines of communication deal was they get my money if they answered one question who running armitage and you think it this ai those things allowed any autonomy it ll be the parent corporation this tessle tessier ashpool s a said the finn and i got a little story for you about them wanna hear he sat down and hunched forward finn molly said he loves a story ever told anybody this one the finn began
CH02-P67,CH02,the finn was a fence a trafficker in stolen goods primarily in software in the course of his business he sometimes came into contact with other fences some of whom dealt in the more traditional articles of the trade in precious metals stamps rare coins gems jewelry furs and paintings and other works of art the story he told case and molly began with another man story a man he called smith smith was also a fence but in balmier seasons he surfaced as an art dealer he was the first person the finn had known who gone silicon the phrase had an old fashioned ring for case and the microsofts he purchased were art history programs and tables of gallery sales with half a dozen chips in his new socket smith knowledge of the art business was formidable at least by the standards of his colleagues but smith had come to the finn with a request for help a fraternal request one businessman to another he wanted a go to on the tessier ashpool clan he said and it had to be executed in a way that would guarantee the impossibility of the subject ever tracing the inquiry to its source it might be possible the finn had opined but an explanation was definitely required it smelled the finn said to case smelled of money and smith was being very careful almost too careful smith it developed had had a supplier known as jimmy jimmy was a burglar and other things as well and just back from a year in high orbit having carried certain things back down the gravity well the most unusual thing jimmy had managed to score on his swing through the archipelago was a head an intricately worked bust cloisonne over platinum studded with seedpearls and lapis smith sighing had put down his pocket microscope and advised jimmy to melt the thing down it was contemporary not an antique and had no value to the collector jimmy laughed the thing was a computer terminal he said it could talk and not in a synth voice but with a beautiful arrangement of gears and miniature organ pipes it was a baroque thing for anyone to have constructed a perverse thing because synth voice chips cost next to nothing it was a curiosity smith jacked the head into his computer and listened as the melodious inhuman voice piped the figures of last year tax return smith s clientele included a tokyo billionaire whose passion for clockwork automata approached fetishism smith shrugged showing jimmy his upturned palms in a gesture old as pawn shops he could try he said but he doubted he could get much for it when jimmy had gone leaving the head smith went over it carefully discovering certain hallmarks eventually he been able to trace it to an unlikely collaboration between two zurich artisans an enamel specialist in paris a dutch jeweler and a california chip designer it had been commissioned he discovered by tessier ashpool s a smith began to make preliminary passes at the tokyo collector hinting that he was on the track of something noteworthy
CH02-P68,CH02,and then he had a visitor a visitor unannounced one who walked in through the elaborate maze of smith security as though it exist a small man japanese enormously polite who bore all the marks of a vatgrown ninja assassin smith sat very still staring into the calm brown eyes of death across a polished table of vietnamese rosewood gently almost apologetically the cloned killer explained that it was his duty to find and return a certain artwork a mechanism of great beauty which had been taken from the house of his master it had come to his attention the ninja said that smith might know of the whereabouts of this object smith told the man that he had no wish to die and produced the head and how much his visitor asked did you expect to obtain through the sale of this object smith named a figure far lower than the price he intended to set the ninja produced a credit chip and keyed smith that amount out of a numbered swiss account and who the man asked brought you this piece smith told him within days smith learned of jimmy death so that was where i came in the finn continued smith knew i dealt a lot with the memory lane crowd and that where you go for a quiet go to that ll never be traced i hired a cowboy i was the cut out so i took a percentage smith he was careful he just had a very weird business experience and he come out on top but it add up who paid out of that swiss stash yakuza no way they got a very rigid code covers situations like that and they kill the receiver too always was it spook stuff smith think so spook biz has a vibe you get so you can smell it well i had my cowboy buzz the news morgues until we found tessier ashpool in litigation the case anything but we got the law firm then he did the lawyer ice and we got the family address lotta good it did us case raised his eyebrows freeside the finn said the spindle turns out they own damn near the whole thing the interesting stuff was the picture we got when the cowboy ran a regular go to on the news morgues and compiled a precis family organization corporate structure supposedly you can buy into an s a but there been a share of tessier ashpool traded on the open market in over a hundred years on any market as far as i know you re looking at a very quiet very eccentric first generation high orbit family run like a corporation big money very shy of media lot of cloning orbital law a lot softer on genetic engineering right and it hard to keep track of which gen eration or combination of generations is running the show at a given time how that molly asked got their own cryogenic setup even under orbital law you re legally dead for the duration of a freeze looks like they trade off though nobody seen the founding father in about thirty years founding momma she died in some lab accident so what happened with your fence nothing the finn frowned dropped it we had a look at this fantastic tangle of powers of attorney the t a have and that was it jimmy must ve gotten into straylight lifted the head and tessier ashpool sent their ninja after it smith decided to forget about it maybe he was smart he looked at molly the villa straylight tip of the spindle strictly private you figure they own that ninja finn molly asked smith thought so expensive she said wonder whatever happened to that little ninja finn probably got him on ice thaw when needed okay case said we got armitage getting his goodies off an ai named wintermute where that get us nowhere yet molly said but you got a little side gig now she drew a folded scrap of paper from her pocket and handed it to him he opened it grid coordinates and entry codes who this armitage some data base of his bought it from the mod erns separate deal where is it london case said crack it she laughed earn your keep for a change
CH02-P69,CH02,case waited for a trans bama local on the crowded plat form molly had gone back to the loft hours ago the flatline construct in her green bag and case had been drinking steadily ever since it was disturbing to think of the flatline as a construct a hardwired rom cassette replicating a dead man skills obsessions kneejerk responses the local came booming in along the black induction strip fine grit sifting from cracks in the tunnel ceiling case shuffled into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode a pair of predatory looking christian scientists were edging toward a trio of young office techs who wore idealized holographic vaginas on their wrists wet pink glittering under the harsh lighting the techs licked their perfect lips nervously and eyed the christian scientists from beneath lowered metallic lids the girls looked like tall exotic grazing animals swaying gracefully and unconsciously with the movement of the train their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car floor before they could stampede take flight from the missionaries the train reached case station he stepped out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar suspended against the wall of the station freeside pulsing beneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed japanese he walked through the crowd and stood beneath it studying the thing why wait pulsed the sign a blunt white spindle flanged and studded with grids and radiators docks domes he seen the ad or others like it thousands of times it had never appealed to him with his deck he could reach the freeside banks as easily as he could reach atlanta travel was a meat thing but now he noticed the little sigil the size of a small coin woven into the lower left corner of the ad fabric of light t a he walked back to the loft lost in memories of the flatline he spent most of his nineteenth summer in the gentleman loser nursing expensive beers and watching the cowboys he never touched a deck then but he knew what he wanted there were at least twenty other hopefuls ghosting the loser that summer each one bent on working joeboy for some cowboy no other way to learn they all heard of pauley the redneck jockey from the lanta fringes who survived braindeath behind black ice the grapevine slender street level and the only one going had little to say about pauley other than that he done the impossible it was big another would be told case for the price of a beer but who knows what i hear maybe a brazilian payroll net anyway the man was dead flat down braindeath case stared across the crowded bar at a thickset man in shirtsleeves something leaden about the shade of his skin boy the flatline would tell him months later in miami i like them huge fuckin lizards you know had themself two goddam brains one in the head an one by the tailbone kept the hind legs movin hit that black stuff and ol tailbrain jus kept right on keepin on the cowboy elite in the loser shunned pauley out of some strange group anxiety almost a superstition mccoy pauley lazarus of cyberspace and his heart had done for him in the end his surplus russian heart implanted in a pow camp during the war he refused to replace the thing saying he needed its particular beat to maintain his sense of timing case fingered the slip of paper molly had given him and made his way up the stairs molly was snoring on the temperfoam a transparent cast ran from her knee to a few millimeters below her crotch the skin beneath the rigid micropore mottled with bruises the black shading into ugly yellow eight derms each a different size and color ran in a neat line down her left wrist an akai transdermal unit lay beside her its fine red leads connected to input trodes under the cast he turned on the tensor beside the hosaka the crisp circle of light fell directly on the flatline construct he slotted some ice connected the construct and jacked in it was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his shoulder he coughed dix mccoy that you man his throat was tight hey bro said a directionless voice it case man remember miami joeboy quick study what the last thing you remember before i spoke to you dix nothin hang on he disconnected the construct the presence was gone he reconnected it dix who am i you got me hung jack who the fuck are you ca your buddy partner what happening man good question remember being here a second ago no know how a rom personality matrix works sure bro it a firmware construct so i jack it into the bank i using i can give it sequential real time memory guess so said the construct okay dix you are a rom construct got me if you say so said the construct who are you case miami said the voice joeboy quick study right and for starts dix you and me we re gonna sleaze over to london grid and access a little data you game for that you gonna tell me i got a choice boy you want you a paradise the flatline advised when case had explained his situation check copenhagen fringes of the university section the voice recited coordinates as he punched they found their paradise a pirate paradise on the jumbled border of a low security academic grid at first glance it resembled the kind of graffiti student operators sometimes left at the junctions of grid lines faint glyphs of colored light that shimmered against the confused outlines of a dozen arts faculties there said the flatline the blue one make it out that an entry code for bell europa fresh too bell ll get in here soon and read the whole damn board change any codes they find posted kids ll steal the new ones tomorrow case tapped his way into bell europa and switched to a standard phone code with the flatline help he connected with the london data base that molly claimed was armitage here said the voice i ll do it for you the flatline began to chant a series of digits case keying them on his deck trying to catch the pauses the construct used to indicate timing it took three tries big deal said the flatline no ice at all scan this shit case told the hosaka sift for owner personal history the neuroelectronic scrawls of the paradise vanished re placed by a simple lozenge of white light contents are pri marily video recordings of postwar military trials said the distant voice of the hosaka central figure is colonel willis corto show it already case said a man face filled the screen the eyes were armitage two hours later case fell beside molly on the slab and let the temperfoam mold itself against him you find anything she asked her voice fuzzy with sleep and drugs tell you later he said i wrecked he was hungover and confused he lay there eyes closed and tried to sort the various parts of a story about a man called corto the hosaka had sorted a thin store of data and assembled a precis but it was full of gaps some of the material had been print records reeling smoothly down the screen too quickly and case had had to ask the computer to read them for him other segments were audio recordings of the screaming fist hearing willis corto colonel had plummeted through a blind spot in the russian defenses over kirensk the shuttles had created the hole with pulse bombs and corto team had dropped in in nightwing microlights their wings snapping taut in moonlight reflected in jags of silver along the rivers angara and podhamennaya the last light corto would see for fifteen months case tried to imagine the microlights blossoming out of their launch capsules high above a frozen steppe they sure as hell did shaft you boss case said and molly stirred beside him the microlights had been unarmed stripped to compensate for the weight of a console operator a prototype deck and a virus program called mole ix the first true virus in the history of cybernetics corto and his team had been training for the run for three years they were through the ice ready to inject mole ix when the emps went off the russian pulse guns threw the jockeys into electronic darkness the nightwings suffered systems crash flight circuitry wiped clean then the lasers opened up aiming on infrared taking out the fragile radar transparent assault planes and corto and his dead console man fell out of a siberian sky fell and kept falling there were gaps in the story here where case scanned documents concerning the flight of a commandeered russian gunship that managed to reach finland to be gutted as it landed in a spruce grove by an antique twenty millimeter can non manned by a cadre of reservists on dawn alert screaming fist had ended for corto on the outskirts of helsinki with finnish paramedics sawing him out of the twisted belly of the helicopter the war ended nine days later and corto was shipped to a military facility in utah blind legless and missing most of his jaw it took eleven months for the congressional aide to find him there he listened to the sound of tubes draining in washington and mclean the show trials were already un derway the pentagon and the cia were being balkanized partially dismantled and a congressional investigation had focused on screaming fist ripe for watergating the aide told corto he need eyes legs and extensive cosmetic work the aide said but that could be arranged new plumbing the man added squeezing corto shoulder through the sweat damp sheet corto heard the soft relentless dripping he said he preferred to testify as he was no the aide explained the trials were being televised the trials needed to reach the voter the aide coughed politely repaired refurnished and extensively rehearsed corto subsequent testimony was detailed moving lucid and largely the invention of a congressional cabal with certain vested interests in saving particular portions of the pentagon infrastructure corto gradually understood that the testimony he gave was instrumental in saving the careers of three officers directly responsible for the suppression of reports on the building of the emp installations at kirensk his role in the trials over he was unwanted in washington in an m street restaurant over asparagus crepes the aide explained the terminal dangers involved in talking to the wrong people corto crushed the man larynx with the rigid fingers of his right hand the congressional aide strangled his face in an asparagus crepe and corto stepped out into cool washington september the hosaka rattled through police reports corporate espionage records and news files case watched corto work corporate defectors in lisbon and marrakesh where he seemed to grow obsessed with the idea of betrayal to loathe the scientists and technicians he bought out for his employers drunk in singapore he beat a russian engineer to death in a hotel and set fire to his room next he surfaced in thailand as overseer of a heroin factory then as enforcer for a california gambling cartel then as a paid killer in the ruins of bonn he robbed a bank in wichita the record grew vague shadowy the gaps longer one day he said in a taped segment that suggested chemical interrogation everything had gone gray translated french medical records explained that a man without identification had been taken to a paris mental health unit and diagnosed as schizophrenic he became catatonic and was sent to a government institution on the outskirts of toulon he became a subject in an experimental program that sought to reverse schizophrenia through the application of cybernetic models a random selection of patients were provided with microcomputers and encouraged with help from students to program them he was cured the only success in the entire experiment the record ended there
CH02-P70,CH02,case turned on the foam and molly cursed him softly for disturbing her the telephone rang he pulled it into bed yeah we re going to istanbul armitage said tonight what does the bastard want molly asked says we re going to istanbul tonight that just wonderful armitage was reading off flight numbers and departure times molly sat up and turned on the light what about my gear case asked my deck finn will handle it said armitage and hung up case watched her pack there were dark circles under her eyes but even with the cast on it was like watching a dance no wasted motion his clothes were a rumpled pile beside his bag you hurting he asked i could do with another night at chin your dentist you betcha very discreet he got half that rack full clinic does repairs for samurai she was zipping her bag you ever been to stanbul couple days once never changes she said bad old town it was like this when we headed for chiba molly said staring out the train window at blasted industrial moonscape red beacons on the horizon warning aircraft away from a fusion plant we were in l a he came in and said pack we were booked for macau when we got there i played fantan in the lisboa and he crossed over into zhongshan next day i was playing ghost with you in night city she took a silk scarf from the sleeve of her black jacket and polished the insets the landscape of the northern sprawl woke confused memories of childhood for case dead grass tufting the cracks in a canted slab of freeway concrete the train began to decelerate ten kilometers from the airport case watched the sun rise on the landscape of childhood on broken slag and the rusting shells of refineries
CH02-P71,CH02,it was raining in beyoglu and the rented mercedes slid past the grilled and unlit windows of cautious greek and armenian jewelers the street was almost empty only a few dark coated figures on the sidewalks turning to stare after the car this was formerly the prosperous european section of ottoman istanbul purred the mercedes so it gone downhill case said the hilton in cumhuriyet caddesi molly said she settled back against the car gray ultrasuede how come armitage flies alone case asked he had a headache cause you get up his nose you re sure getting up mine he wanted to tell her the corto story but decided against it he used a sleep derm on the plane the road in from the airport had been dead straight like a neat incision laying the city open he watched the crazy walls of patchwork wooden tenements slide by condos arcologies grim housing projects more walls of plyboard and corrugated iron the finn in a new shinjuku suit sarariman black was waiting sourly in the hilton lobby marooned on a velour armchair in a sea of pale blue carpeting christ molly said rat in a business suit they crossed the lobby how much you get paid to come over here finn she lowered her bag beside the armchair bet not as much as you get for wearing that suit huh the finn s upper lips drew back not enough sweetmeat he handed her a magnetic key with a round yellow tag you re registered already honcho upstairs he looked around this town sucks you get agoraphobic they take you out from under a dome just pretend it brooklyn or something she twirled the key around a finger you here as valet or what i gotta check out some guy implants the finn said how about my deck case asked the finn winced observe the protocol ask the boss molly fingers moved in the shadow of her jacket a flicker of jive the finn watched then nodded yeah she said i know who that is she jerked her head in the direction of the elevators come on cowboy case followed her with both bags

CH02-P74,CH02,once they entered the bazaar the finn brightened notice ably as though he were comforted by the crowd density and the sense of enclosure they walked with the armenian along a broad concourse beneath soot stained sheets of plastic and green painted ironwork out of the age of steam a thousand suspended ads writhed and flickered hey christ the finn said taking case arm looka that he pointed it a horse man you ever see a horse case glanced at the embalmed animal and shook his head it was displayed on a sort of pedestal near the entrance to a place that sold birds and monkeys the thing legs had been worn black and hairless by decades of passing hands saw one in maryland once the finn said and that was a good three years after the pandemic there arabs still trying to code em up from the dna but they always croak the animal brown glass eyes seemed to follow them as they passed terzibashjian led them into a cafe near the core of the market a low ceilinged room that looked as though it had been in continuous operation for centuries skinny boys in soiled white coats dodged between the crowded tables bal ancing steel trays with bottles of turk tuborg and tiny glasses of tea case bought a pack of yeheyuans from a vendor by the door the armenian was muttering to his sanyo come he said he is moving each night he rides the tunel to the bazaar to purchase his mixture from ali your woman is close come
CH02-P75,CH02,the alley was an old place too old the walls cut from blocks of dark stone the pavement was uneven and smelled of a century dripping gasoline absorbed by ancient limestone see shit he whispered to the finn that okay for sweetmeat the finn said quiet said terzibashjian too loudly wood grated on stone or concrete ten meters down the alley a wedge of yellow light fell across wet cobbles widened a figure stepped out and the door grated shut again leaving the narrow place in darkness case shivered now terzibashjian said and a brilliant beam of white light directed from the rooftop of the building opposite the market pinned the slender figure beside the ancient wooden door in a perfect circle bright eyes darted left right and the man crumpled case thought someone had shot him he lay face down blond hair pale against the old stone his limp hands white and pathetic the floodlight never wavered the back of the fallen man jacket heaved and burst blood splashing the wall and doorway a pair of impossibly long rope tendoned arms flexed grayish pink in the glare the thing seemed to pull itself up out of the pavement through the inert bloody ruin that had been riviera it was two meters tall stood on two legs and seemed to be headless then it swung slowly to face them and case saw that it had a head but no neck it was eyeless the skin gleaming a wet intestinal pink the mouth if it was a mouth was circular conical shallow and lined with a seething growth of hairs or bristles glittering like black chrome it kicked the rags of clothing and flesh aside and took a step the mouth seeming to scan for them as it moved terzibashjian said something in greek or turkish and rushed the thing his arms spread like a man attempting to dive through a window he went through it into the muzzle flash of a pistol from the dark beyond the circle of light fragments of rock whizzed past case head the finn jerked him down into a crouch the light from the rooftop vanished leaving him with mis matched afterimages of muzzle flash monster and white beam his ears rang then the light returned bobbing now searching the shad ows terzibashjian was leaning against a steel door his face very white in the glare he held his left wrist and watched blood drip from a wound in his left hand the blond man whole again unbloodied lay at his feet molly stepped out of the shadows all in black with her fletcher in her hand use the radio the armenian said through gritted teeth call in mahmut we must get him out of here this is not a good place little prick nearly made it the finn said his knees crack ing loudly as he stood up brushing ineffectually at the legs of his trousers you were watching the horror show right not the hamburger that got tossed out of sight real cute well help em get his ass outa here i gotta scan all that gear before he wakes up make sure armitage is getting his money worth molly bent and picked something up a pistol a nambu she said nice gun terzibashjian made a whining sound case saw that most of his middle finger was missing

CH03-P91,CH03,dix case said i wanna have a look at an ai in berne can you think of any reason not to not unless you got a morbid fear of death no case punched for the swiss banking sector feeling a wave of exhilaration as cyberspace shivered blurred gelled the eastern seaboard fission authority was gone replaced by the cool geometric intricacy of zurich commercial banking he punched again for berne up the construct said it ll be high they ascended lattices of light levels strobing a blue flicker that ll be it case thought wintermute was a simple cube of white light that very simplicity suggesting extreme complexity look much does it the flatline said but just you try and touch it i going in for a pass dixie be my guest
CH03-P92,CH03,case punched to within four grid points of the cube its blank face towering above him now began to seethe with faint internal shadows as though a thousand dancers whirled behind a vast sheet of frosted glass knows we re here the flatline observed case punched again once they jumped forward by a single grid point a stippled gray circle formed on the face of the cube dixie back off fast the gray area bulged smoothly became a sphere and de tached itself from the cube case felt the edge of the deck sting his palm as he slapped max reverse the matrix blurred backward they plunged down a twilit shaft of swiss banks he looked up the sphere was darker now gaining on him falling jack out the flatline said the dark came down like a hammer
CH03-P93,CH03,cold steel odor and ice caressed his spine and faces peering in from a neon forest sailors and hustlers and whores under a poisoned silver sky look case you tell me what the fuck is going on with you you wig or something a steady pulse of pain midway down his spine
CH03-P94,CH03,rain woke him a slow drizzle his feet tangled in coils of discarded fiberoptics the arcade sea of sound washed over him receded returned rolling over he sat up and held his head light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console streamlined japanese was stenciled across the side of the console in faded pinks and yellows he glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window a faint glow of fluorescents his back hurt his spine he got to his feet brushed wet hair out of his eyes something had happened he searched his pockets for money found nothing and shivered where was his jacket he tried to find it looked behind the console but gave up on ninsei he took the measure of the crowd friday it had to be a friday linda was probably in the arcade might have money or at least cigarettes coughing wringing rain from the front of his shirt he edged through the crowd to the arcade entrance holograms twisted and shuddered to the roaring of the games ghosts overlapping in the crowded haze of the place a smell of sweat and bored tension a sailor in a white t shirt nuked bonn on a tank war console an azure flash she was playing wizard castle lost in it her gray eyes rimmed with smudged black paintstick she looked up as he put his arm around her smiled hey how you doin look wet he kissed her you made me blow my game she said look there ass hole seventh level dungeon and the god dam vampires got me she passed him a cigarette you look pretty strung man where you been i know you high case drinkin again eatin zone dex maybe how long since you seen me hey it a put on right she peered at him right no some kind of blackout i i woke up in the alley maybe somebody decked you baby got your roll intact he shook his head there you go you need a place to sleep case i guess so come on then she took his hand we ll get you a coffee and something to eat take you home it good to see you man she squeezed his hand he smiled something cracked something shifted at the core of things the arcade froze vibrated
CH03-P95,CH03,she was gone the weight of memory came down an entire body of knowledge driven into his head like a microsoft into a socket gone he smelled burning meat the sailor in the white t shirt was gone the arcade was empty silent case turned slowly his shoulders hunched teeth bared his hands bunched into involuntary fists empty a crumpled yellow candy wrapper balanced on the edge of a console dropped to the floor and lay amid flattened butts and styrofoam cups i had a cigarette case said looking down at his white knuckled fist i had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep do you hear me you son of a bitch you hear me echoes moved through the hollow of the arcade fading down corridors of consoles he stepped out into the street the rain had stopped ninsei was deserted holograms flickered neon danced he smelled boiled veg etables from a vendor pushcart across the street an unopened pack of yeheyuans lay at his feet beside a book of matches julius deane import export case staled at the printed logo and its japanese translation okay he said picking up the matches and opening the pack of cigarettes i hear you
CH03-P96,CH03,he took his time climbing the stairs of deane office no rush he told himself no hurry the sagging face of the dali clock still told the wrong time there was dust on the kandinsky table and the neo aztec bookcases a wall of white fiberglass shipping modules filled the room with a smell of ginger is the door locked case waited for an answer but none came he crossed to the office door and tried it julie the green shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on deane desk case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter at cas settes crumpled printouts at sticky plastic bags filled with ginger samples there was no one there case stepped around the broad steel desk and pushed deane chair out of the way he found the gun in a cracked leather holster fastened beneath the desk with silver tape it was an antique a magnum with the barrel and trigger guard sawn off the grip had been built up with layers of masking tape the tape was old brown shiny with a patina of dirt he flipped the cylinder out and examined each of the six cartridges they were handloads the soft lead was still bright and untarnished with the revolver in his right hand case edged past the cabinet to the left of the desk and stepped into the center of the cluttered office away from the pool of light i guess i not in any hurry i guess it your show but all this shit you know it getting kind of old he raised the gun with both hands aiming for the center of the desk and pulled the trigger the recoil nearly broke his wrist the muzzle flash lit the office like a flashbulb with his ears ringing he stared at the jagged hole in the front of the desk explosive bullet azide he raised the gun again you do that old son julie said stepping out of the shadows he wore a three piece drape suit in silk her ing bone a striped shirt and a bow tie his glasses winked in the light case brought the gun around and looked down the line of sight at deane pink ageless face deane said you re right about what this all is what i am but there are certain internal logics to be honored if you use that you ll see a lot of brains and blood and it would take me several hours your subjective time to effect another spokesperson this set easy for me to maintain oh and i sorry about linda in the arcade i was hoping to speak through her but i generating all this out of your memories and the emotional charge well it very tricky i slipped sorry case lowered the gun this is the matrix you re winter mute yes this is all coming to you courtesy of the simstim unit wired into your deck of course i glad i was able to cut you off before you managed to jack out deane walked around the desk straightened his chair and sat down sit old son we have a lot to talk about do we of course we do we have had for some time i was ready when i reached you by phone in istanbul time very short now you ll be making your run in a matter of days case deane picked up a bonbon and stripped off its checkered wrap pcr popped h into his mouth sit he said around the candy case lowered himself into the swivel chair in front of the desk without taking his eyes off deane he sat with the gun in his hand resting it on his thigh now deane said briskly order of the day what you re asking yourself is wintermute am i right more or less an artificial intelligence but you know that your mistake and it quite a logical one is in confusing the winterrnute mainframe berne with the wintermute entity deane sucked his bonbon noisily you re already aware of the other ai in tessier ashpool link up you rio i insofar as i have an i this gets rather metaphysical you see i am the one who arranges things for armitage or corto who by the way is quite unstable stable enough said deane and withdrew an ornate gold watch from a vest pocket and flicked it open for the next day or so you make about as much sense as anything in this deal ever has case said massaging his temples with his free hand if you re so goddam smart why i rich deane laughed and nearly choked on his bonbon well case all i can say to that and i really have nearly as many answers as you imagine i do is that what you think of as wintermute is only a part of another a shall we say potential entity i let us say am merely one aspect of that entity brain it rather like dealing from your point of view with a man whose lobes have been severed let say you re dealing with a small part of the man left brain difficult to say if you re dealing with the man at all in a case like that deane smiled is the corto story true you got to him through a micro in that french hospital yes and i assembled the file you accessed in london i try to plan in your sense of the word but that my basic mode really i improvise it my greatest talent i prefer situations to plans you see really i ve had to deal with givens i can sort a great deal of information and sort it very quickly it taken a very long time to assemble the team you re a part of corto was the first and he very nearly make it very far gone in toulon eating excreting and mastur bating were the best he could manage but the underlying structure of obsessions was there screaming fist his betrayal the congressional hearings is he still crazy he not quite a personality deane smiled but i sure you re aware of that but corto is in there somewhere and i can no longer maintain that delicate balance he going to come apart on you case so i ll be counting on you that good motherfucker case said and shot him in the mouth with the he been right about the brains and the blood
CH03-P97,CH03,mon maelcum was saying i like this it cool molly said it just okay it something these guys do is all like he dead and it was only a few seconds i saw th screen eeg readin dead nothin movin forty second well he okay now eeg flat as a strap maelcum protested he was numb as they went through customs and molly did most of the talking maelcum remained on board garvey customs for freeside consisted mainly of proving your credit the first thing he saw when they gained the inner surface of the spindle was a branch of the beautiful girl coffee franchise welcome to the rue jules verne molly said if you have trouble walking just look at your feet the perspective a bitch if you re not used to it they were standing in a broad street that seemed to be the floor of a deep slot or canyon its either end concealed by subtle angles in the shops and buildings that formed its walls the light here was filtered through fiesh green masses of vege tation tumbling from overhanging tiers and balconies that rose above them the sun there was a brilliant slash of white somewhere above them too bright and the recorded blue of a cannes sky he knew that sunlight was pumped in with a lado acheson system whose two millimeter armature ran the length of the spindle that they generated a rotating library of sky effects around it that if the sky were turned off he stare up past the armature of light to the curves of lakes rooftops of casinos other streets but it made no sense to his body jesus he said i like this less than sas get used to it i was a gambler bodyguard here for a month wanna go somewhere lie down okay i got our keys she touched his shoulder what happened to you back there man you flatlined he shook his head i dunno yet wait okay we get a cab or something she took his hand and led him across jules verne past a window displaying the sea son paris furs unreal he said looking up again nah she responded assuming he meant the furs grow it on a collagen base but it mink dna what it matter
CH03-P98,CH03,it just a big tube and they pour things through it molly said tourists hustlers anything and there fine mesh money screens working every minute make sure the money stays here when the people fall back down the well armitage had booked them into a place called the inter continental a sloping glass fronted clff face that slid down into cold mist and the sound of rapids case went out onto their balcony and watched a trio of tanned french teenagers ride simple hang gliders a few meters above the spray triangles of nylon in bright primary colors one of them swung banked and case caught a flash of cropped dark hair brown breasts white teeth in a wide smile the air here smelled of running water and flowers yeah he said lotta money she leaned beside him against the railing her hands loose and relaxed yeah we were gonna come here once either here or some place in europe we who nobody she said giving her shoulders an involuntary toss you said you wanted to hit the bed sleep i could use some sleep yeah case said rubbing his palms across his cheek bones yeah this is some place the narrow band of the lado acheson system smoldered in absract imitation of some bermudan sunset striped by shreds of worded cloud yeah he said sleep sleep come when it did it brought dreams that were like neatly edited segments of memory he woke re peatedly molly curled beside him and heard the water voices drifting in through the open glass panels of the balcony a woman laughter from the stepped condos on the opposite slope deane death kept turning up like a bad card no matter if he told himself that it been deane that it in fact happened at all someone had once told him that the amount of blood in the average human body was roughly equiv alent to a case of beer each time the image of deane shattered head struck the rear wall of the office case was aware of another thought something darker hidden that rolled away diving like a fish just beyond his reach linda deane blood on the wall of the importer office linda smell of burnt flesh in the shadows of the chiba dome molly holding out a bag of ginger the plastic filmed with blood deane had had her killed wintermute he imagined a little micro whispering to the wreck of a man named corto the words flowing like a river the flat personality substitute called armitage accreting slowly in some darkened ward the deane analog had said it worked with givens took advantage of existing situations but what if deane the real deane had ordered linda killed on wintermute orders case groped in the dark for a cigarette and molly lighter there was no reason to suspect deane he told himself lighting up no reason wintermute could build a kind of personality into a shell how subtle a form could manipulation take he stubbed the yeheyuan out in a bedside ashtray after his third puff rolled away from molly and tried to sleep the dream the memory unreeled with the monotony of an unedited simstim tape he spent a month his fifteenth sum mer in a weekly rates hotel fifth floor with a girl called marlene the elevator worked in a decade roaches boiled across grayish porcelain in the drain plugged kitchenette when you flicked a lightswitch he slept with marlene on a striped mattress with no sheets he missed the first wasp when it built its paperfine gray house on the blistered paint of the windowframe but soon the nest was a fist sized lump of fiber insects hurtling out to hunt the alley below like miniature copters buzzing the rotting con tents of the dumpsters they each had a dozen beers the afternoon a wasp stung marlene kill the fuckers she said her eyes dull with rage and the still heat of the room burn em drunk case rum maged in the sour closet for rollo dragon rollo was mar lene previous and case suspected at the time still occasional boyfriend an enormous frisco biker with a blond lightning bolt bleached into his dark crewcut the dragon was a frisco flamethrower a thing like a fat anglehead flashlight case checked the batteries shook it to make sure he had enough fuel and went to the open window the hive began to buzz the air in the sprawl was dead immobile a wasp shot from the nest and circled case head case pressed the ignition switch counted three and pulled the trigger the fuel pumped up to l psi sprayed out past the white hot coil a five meter tongue of pale fire the nest charring tumbling across the alley someone cheered shit marlene behind him swaying stupid you burn em you just knocked it off they ll come up here and kill us her voice sawing at his nerves he imagined her en gulfed in flame her bleached hair sizzling a special green in the alley the dragon in hand he approached the black ened nest it had broken open singed wasps wrenched and flipped on the asphalt he saw the thing the shell of gray paper had concealed horror the spiral birth factory stepped terraces of the hatching cells blind jaws of the unborn moving ceaselessly the staged progress from egg to larva near wasp wasp in his mind eye a kind of time lapse photography took place re vealing the thing as the biological equivalent of a machine gun hideous in its perfection alien he pulled the trigger forgetting to press the ignition and fuel hissed over the bulging writhing life at his feet when he did hit the ignition it exploded with a thump taking an eyebrow with it five floors above him from the open window he heard marlene laughing he woke with the impression of light fading but the room was dark afterimages retinal flares the sky outside hinted at the start of a recorded dawn there were no voices now only the rush of water far down the face of the intercontinental in the dream just before he drenched the nest with fuel he seen the t a logo of tessier ashpool neatly embossed into its side as though the wasps themselves had worked it there
CH03-P99,CH03,molly insisted on coating him with bronzer saying his sprawl pallor would attract too much attention christ he said standing naked in front of the mirror you think that looks real she was using the last of the tube on his left ankle kneeling beside him nah but it looks like you care enough to fake it there there enough to do your foot she stood tossing the empty tube into a large wicker basket nothing in the room looked as though it had been machine made or produced from synthetics expensive case knew but it was a style that had always irritated him the temperfoam of the huge bed was tinted to resemble sand there was a lot of pale wood and handwoven fabric what about you he said you gonna dye yourself brown exactly look like you spend all your time sunbathing she wore loose black silks and black espadrilles i an exotic i got a big straw hat for this too you you just wanna look like a cheap ass hood who up for what he can get so the instant tan okay case regarded his pallid foot morosely then looked at him self in the mirror christ you mind if i get dressed now he went to the bed and began to pull his jeans on you sleep okay you notice any lights you were dreaming she said they had breakfast on the roof of the hotel a kind of meadow studded with striped umbrellas and what seemed to case an unnatural number of trees he told her about his attempt to buzz the berne ai the whole question of bugging seemed to have become academic if armitage were tapping them he be doing it through wintermute and it was like real she asked her mouth full of cheese croissant like simstim he said it was real as this he added looking around maybe more the trees were small gnarled impossibly old the result of genetic engineering and chemical manipulation case would have been hard pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak but a street boy sense of style told him that these were too cute too entirely and definitively treelike between the trees on gentle and too cleverly irregular slopes of sweet green grass the bright umbrellas shaded the hotel guests from the unfal tering radiance of the lado acheson sun a burst of french from a nearby table caught his attention the golden children he seen gliding above river mist the evening before now he saw that their tans were uneven a stencil effect produced by selective melanin boosting multiple shades overlapping in rec tilinear patterns outlining and highlighting musculature the girl small hard breasts one boy wrist resting on the white enamel of the table they looked to case like machines built for racing they deserved decals for their hairdressers the de signers of their white cotton ducks for the artisans who crafted their leather sandals and simple jewelry beyond them at another table three japanese wives in hiroshima sackcloth awaited sarariman husbands their oval faces covered with ar tificial bruises it was he knew an extremely conservative style one he seldom seen in chiba what that smell he asked molly wrinkling his nose the grass smells that way after they cut it armitage and riviera arrived as they were finishing their coffee armitage in tailored khakis that made him look as though his regimental patches had just been stripped riviera in a loose gray seersucker outfit that perversely suggested prison molly love riviera said almost before he was settled on his chair you ll have to dole me out more of the medicine i out peter she said and what if i she smiled without showing her teeth you will riviera said his eyes cutting to armitage and back give it to him armitage said pig for it you she took a flat foil wrapped packet from an inside pocket and flipped it across the table riviera caught it in midair he could off himself she said to ar mitage i have an audition this afternoon riviera said i ll need to be at my best he cupped the foil packd in his uptumed palm and smiled small glittering insects swarmed out of it vanished he dropped it into the pocket of his seersucker blouse you ve got an audition yourself case this afternoon armitage said on that tug i want you to get over to the pro shop and get yourself fitted for a vac suit get checked out on it and get out to the boat you ve got about three hours how come we get shipped over in a shitcan and you two hire a jal taxi case asked deliberately avoiding the man eyes zion suggested we use it good cover when we move i do have a larger boat standing by but the tug is a nice touch how about me molly asked i got chores today i want you to hike up the far end to the axis work out in zero g tomorrow maybe you can hike in the opposite di rection straylight case thought how soon case asked meedng the pale stare soon armitage said get going case mon you doin jus fine maelcum said helping case out of the red sanyo vacuum suit aerol say you doin jus fine aerol had been waiting at one of the sporting docks at the end of the spindle near the weightless axis to reach it case had taken an elevator down to the hull and ridden a miniature induction train as the diameter of the spindle nar rowed gravity decreased somewhere above him he decided would be the mountains molly climbed the bicycle loop launching gear for the hang gliders and miniature microlights aerol had ferried him out to marcus garvey in a skeletal scooter frame with a chemical engine two hour ago maelcum said i take delivery of babylon goods for you nice lapan boy inna yacht mos pretty yacht free of the suit case pulled himself gingerly over the ho saka and fumbled into the straps of the web well he said let see it maelcum produced a white lump of foam slightly smaller than case head fished a pearl handled switchblade on a green nylon lanyard out of the hip pocket of his tattered shorts and carefully slit the plasdc he extracted a rectangular object and passed it to case thas part some gun mon no case said turning it over but it a weapon it virus not on this boy tug mon maelcum said firmly reaching for the steel cassette a program virus program get into you even get into your software i ve got to interface it through the deck before it can work on anything well japan mon he says hosaka here ll tell you every what an wherefore you wanna know okay well you leave me to it okay maelcum kicked off and drifted past the pilot console bus ying himself with a caulk gun case hastily looked away from the waving fronds of transparent caulk he sure why but something about them brought back the nausea of sas what is this thing he asked the hosaka parcel for me data transfer from bockris systems gmbh frankfurt ad vises under coded transmission that content of shipment is kuang grade mark eleven penetration program bockris fur ther advises that interface with ono sendai cyberspace is entirely compatdble and yields optimal penetradon capabilities particularly with regard to existing military systems how about an ai existing military systems and artificial intelligences jesus christ what did you call it kuang grade mark eleven it chinese yes off case fastened the virus cassette to the side of the hosaka with a length of silver tape remembering molly story of her day in macao armitage had crossed the border into zhongshan on he said changing his mind questdon who owns bockris the people in frankfurt delay for interorbital transmission said the hosaka code it standard commerical code done he drummed his hands on the ono sendai reinhold scientdfic a g berne do it again who owns reinhold it took three more jumps up the ladder before he reached tessier ashpool dixie he said jacking in what do you know about chinese virus programs not a whole hell of a lot ever hear of a grading system like kuang mark eleven no case sighed well i got a user friendly chinese icebreaker here a one shot cassette some people in frankfurt say it ll cut an al possible sure if it military looks like it listen dix and gimme the benefit of your background okay arrnitage seems to be setdng up a run on an al that belongs to tessier ashpool the mainframe in berne but it linked with another one in rio the one in rio is the one that flatlined you that first time so it looks like they link via straylight the t a home base down the end of the spindle and we re supposed to cut our way in with the chinese icebreaker so if wintermute backing the whole show it paying us to burn it it burning itself and something that calls itself wintermute is trying to get on my good side get me to maybe shaft annitage what goes motive the construct said real motive problem with an al not human see well yeah obviously nope i mean it not human and you get a handle on it me i not human either but i respond like one see wait a sec case said are you sentient or not well it feels like i am kid but i really just a bunch of rom it one of them ah philosophical questions i guess the ugly laughter sensation rattled down case spine but i likely to write you no poem if you follow me your ai it just might but it no way human so you figure we get on to its motive it own itself swiss citizen but t a own the basic software and the mainframe that a good one the construct said like i own your brain and what you know but your thoughts have swiss citi zenship sure lotsa luck ai so it getting ready to burn itself case began to punch the deck nervously at random the matrix blurred resolved and he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim steel combine autonomy that the bugaboo where your ai are con cerned my guess case you re going in there to cut the hard wired shackles that keep this baby from getting any smarter and i see how you distinguish say between a move the parent company makes and some move the ai makes on its own so that maybe where the confusion comes in again the nonlaugh see those things they can work real hard buy themselves time to write cookbooks or whatever but the min ute i mean the nanosecond that one starts figuring out ways to make itself smarter turing ll wipe it nobody trusts those fuckers you know that every al ever built has an electro magnetic shotgun wired to its forehead case glared at the pink spheres of sikkim okay he said finally i slotting this virus i want you to scan its instruction face and tell me what you think the half sense of someone reading over his shoulder was gone for a few seconds then returned hot shit case it a slow virus take six

CH03-P100,CH03,molly was sleeping when he returned to the intercontinental he sat on the balcony and watched a microlight with rainbow polymer wings as it soared up the curve of freeside its tri angular shadow tracking across meadows and rooftops until it vanished behind the band of the lado acheson system i wanna buzz he said to the blue artifice of the sky i truly do wanna get high you know trick pancreas plugs in my liver little bags of shit melting fuck it all i wanna buzz he left without waking molly he thought he was never sure with the glasses he shrugged tension from his shoulders and got into the elevator he rode up with an italian girl in spotless whites cheekbones and nose daubed with something black and nonreflective her white nylon shoes had steel cleats the expensive looking thing in her hand resembled a cross be tween a miniature oar and an orthopedic brace she was off for a fast game of something but case had no idea what on the roof meadow he made his way through the grove of trees and umbrellas until he found a pool naked bodies gleaming against turquoise tiles he edged into the shadow of an awning and pressed his chip against a dark glass plate sushi he said whatever you got ten minutes later an enthusiastic chinese waiter arrived with his food he munched raw tuna and rice and watched people tan christ he said to his tuna i go nuts tell me someone said i know it already you re a gangster right he squinted up at her against the band of sun a long young body and a melanin boosted tan but not one of the paris jobs she squatted beside his chair dripping water on the tiles cath she said lupus after a pause what kind of name is that greek he said are you really a gangster the melanin boost pre vented the formation of freckles i a drug addict cath what kind stimulants central nervous system stimulants extremely powerful central nervous system stimulants well do you have any she leaned closer drops of chlorinated water fell on the leg of his pants no that my problem cath do you know where we can get some cath rocked back on her tanned heels and licked at a strand of brownish hair that had pasted itself beside her mouth what your taste no coke no amphetamines but up gotta be up and so much for that he thought glumly holding his smile for her betaphenethylamine she said no sweat but it on your chip

CH03-P103,CH03,case what wrong with you armitage said as the waiter was seating them at his table in the vingtieme siecle it was the smallest and most expensive of several floating restaurants on a small lake near the intercontinental case shuddered bruce said anything about after ef fects he tried to pick up a glass of ice water but his hands were shaking something i ate maybe i want you checked out by a medic armitage said just this hystamine reaction case lied get it when i travel eat different stuff sometimes armitage wore a dark suit too formal for the place and a white silk shirt his gold bracelet rattled as he raised his wine and sipped i ve ordered for you he said molly and armitage ate in silence while case sawed shakily at his steak reducing it to uneaten bite sized fragments which he pushed around in the rich sauce finally abandoning the whole thing jesus molly said her own plate empty gimme that you know what this costs she took his plate they gotta raise a whole animal for years and then they kill it this vat stuff she forked a mouthful up and chewed not hungry case managed his brain was deep fried no he decided it had been thrown into hot fat and left there and the fat had cooled a thick dull grease congealing on the wrinkled lobes shot through with greenish purple flashes of pain you look fucking awful molly said cheerfully case tried the wine the aftermath of the betaphenethylam ine made it taste like iodine the lights dimmed le restaurant vingtieme siecle said a disembodied voice with a pronounced sprawl accent proudly presents the hol ographic cabaret of mr peter riviera scattered applause from the other tables a waiter lit a single candle and placed it in the center of their table then began to remove the dishes soon a candle flickered at each of the restaurant dozen tables and drinks were being poured what happening case asked armitage who said noth ing molly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail good evening riviera said stepping forward on a small stage at the far end of the room case blinked in his discomfort he noticed the stage he seen where riviera had come from his uneasiness increased at first he assumed the man was illuminated by a spotlight riviera glowed the light clung around him like a skin lit the dark hangings behind the stage he was projecting riviera smiled he wore a white dinner jacket on his lapel blue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation his fin gernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting an embrace for his audience case heard the shallow water lap against the side of the restaurant tonight riviera said his long eyes shining i would like to perform an extended piece for you a new work a cool ruby of light formed in the palm of his upraised right hand he dropped it a gray dove fluttered up from the point of impact and vanished into the shadows someone whistled more applause the title of the work is the doll riviera lowered his hands i wish to dedicate its premiere here tonight to lady jane marie france tessier ashpool a wave of polite ap plause as it died riviera eyes seemed to find their table and to another lady the restaurant lights died entirely for a few seconds leaving only the glow of candles riviera holographic aura had faded with the lights but case could still see him standing with his head bowed lines of faint light began to form verticals and horizontals sketching an open cube around the stage the restaurant lights had come back up slightly but the framework surrounding the stage might have been constructed of frozen moonbeams head bowed eyes closed arms rigid at his sides riviera seemed to quiver with concentration suddenly the ghostly cube was filled had become a room a room lacking its fourth wall allowing the audience to view its contents riviera seemed to relax slightly he raised his head but kept his eyes closed i always lived in the room he said i remember ever having lived in any other room the room walls were yellowed white plaster it contained two pieces of furniture one was a plain wooden chair the other an iron bedstead painted white the paint had chipped and flaked revealing the black iron the mattress on the bed was bare stained ticking with faded brown stripes a single bulb dangled above the bed on a twisted length of black wire case could see the thick coating of dust on the bulb upper curve riviera opened his eyes i been alone in the room always he sat on the chair facing the bed the blue coals still burned in the black flower on his lapel i know when i first began to dream of her he said but i do remember that at first she was only a haze a shadow there was something on the bed case blinked gone i quite hold her hold her in my mind but i wanted to hold her hold her and more his voice carried perfectly in the hush of the restaurant ice clicked against the side of a glass someone giggled someone else asked a whispered ques tion in japanese i decided that if i could visualize some part of her only a small part if i could see that part perfectly in the most perfect detail a woman hand lay on the mattress now palm up the white fingers pale riviera leaned forward picked up the hand and began to stroke it gently the fingers moved riviera raised the hand to his mouth and began to lick the tips of the fingers the nails were coated with a burgundy lacquer a hand case saw but not a severed hand the skin swept back smoothly unbroken and unscarred he remembered a tattooed lozenge of vatgrown flesh in the window of a ninsei surgical boutique riviera was holding the hand to his lips licking its palm the fingers tentatively caressed his face but now a second hand lay on the bed when riviera reached for it the fingers of the first were locked around his wrist a bracelet of flesh and bone the act progressed with a surreal internal logic of its own the arms were next feet legs the legs were very beautiful case head throbbed his throat was dry he drank the last of the wine riviera was in the bed now naked his clothing had been a part of the projection but case remember seeing it fade away the black flower lay at the foot of the bed still seething with its blue inner flame then the torso formed as riviera caressed it into being white headless and perfect sheened with the faintest gloss of sweat molly body case stared his mouth open but it molly it was molly as riviera imagined her the breasts were wrong the nipples larger too dark riviera and the limbless torso writhed together on the bed crawled over by the hands with their bright nails the bed was thick now with folds of yellowed rotting lace that crumbled at a touch motes of dust boiled around riviera and the twitching limbs the scurrying pinching caressing hands case glanced at molly her face was blank the colors of riviera projection heaved and turned in her mirrors armitage was leaning forward his hands round the stem of a wineglass his pale eyes fixed on the stage the glowing room now limbs and torso had merged and riviera shuddered the head was there the image complete molly face with smooth quicksilver drowning the eyes riviera and the molly image began to couple with a renewed intensity then the image slowly extended a clawed hand and extruded its five blades with a languorous dreamlike deliberation it raked riviera bare back case caught a glimpse of exposed spine but he was already up and stumbling for the door he vomited over a rosewood railing into the quiet waters of the lake something that had seemed to close around his head like a vise had released him now kneeling his cheek against the cool wood he stared across the shallow lake at the bright aura of the rue jules verne case had seen the medium before when he been a teenager in the sprawl they called it reaming real he remem bered thin puerto ricans under east side streetlights dreaming real to the quick beat of a salsa dreamgirls shuddering and turning the onlookers clapping in time but that had needed a van full of gear and a clumsy trode helmet what riviera dreamed you got case shook his aching head and spat into the lake he could guess the end the finale there was an inverted symmetry riviera puts the dreamgirl together the dreamgirl takes him apart with those hands dreamblood soaking the rotten lace cheers from the restaurant applause case stood and ran his hands over his clothes he turned and walked back into the vingtieme siecle molly chair was empty the stage was deserted armitage sat alone still staring at the stage the stem of the wineglass between his fingers where is she case asked gone armitage said she go after him no there was a soft tink armitage looked down at the glass his left hand came up holding the bulb of glass with its measure of red wine the broken stem protruded like a sliver of ice case took it from him and set it in a water glass tell me where she went armitage the lights came up case looked into the pale eyes nothing there at all she gone to prepare herself you see her again you ll be together during the run why did riviera do that to her armitage stood adjusting the lapels of his jacket get some sleep case we run tomorrow armitage smiled his meaningless smile and walked away toward the exit case rubbed his forehead and looked around the room the diners were rising women smiling as men made jokes he noticed the balcony for the first time candles still flickering there in private darkness he heard the clink of silverware muted conversation the candles threw dancing shadows on the ceiling the girl face appeared as abruptly as one of riviera projections her small hands on the polished wood of the bal ustrade she leaned forward face rapt it seemed to him her dark eyes intent on something beyond the stage it was a striking face but not beautiful triangular the cheekbones high yet strangely fragile looking mouth wide and firm balanced oddly by a narrow avian nose with flaring nostrils and then she was gone back into private laughter and the dance of candles as he left the restaurant he noticed the two young french men and their girlfriend who were waiting for the boat to the far shore and the nearest casino
CH03-P104,CH03,their room was silent the temperfoam smooth as some beach after a retreating tide her bag was gone he looked for a note there was nothing several seconds passed before the scene beyond the window registered through his tension and unhappiness he looked up and saw a view of desiderata expensive shops gucci tsuyako hermes liberty he stared then shook his head and crossed to a panel he bothered examining he turned the hologram off and was rewarded with the condos that terraced the far slope he picked up the phone and carried it out to the cool balcony get me a number for the marcus garvey he told the desk it a tug registered out of zion cluster the chip voice recited a ten digit number sir it added the registration in question is panamanian maelcum answered on the fifth tone yo case you got a modem maelcum yo on th navigation comp ya know can you get it off for me man put it on my hosaka then turn my deck on it the stud with the ridges on it how you doin in there mon well i need some help movin mon i get th modem case listened to faint static while maelcum attached the simple phone link ice this he told the hosaka when he heard it beep you are speaking from a heavily monitored location the computer advised primly fuck it he said forget the ice no ice access the construct dixie hey case the flatline spoke through the hosaka voice chip the carefully engineered accent lost entirely dix you re about to punch your way in here and get something for me you can be as blunt as you want molly in here somewhere and i wanna know where i in w the intercontinental she was registered here too but i know what name she was using ride in on this phone and do their records for me no sooner said the flatline said case heard the white sound of the invasion he smiled done rose kolodny checked out take me a few minutes to screw their security net deep enough to get a fix go the phone whined and clicked with the construct efforts case carried it back into the room and put the receiver face up on the temperfoam he went into the bathroom and brushed his teeth as he was stepping back out the monitor on the room braun audiovisual complex lit up a japanese pop star reclining against metallic cushions an unseen interviewer asked a question in german case stared the screen jumped with jags of blue interference case baby you lose your mind man the voice was slow familiar the glass wall of the balcony clicked in with its view of desiderata but the street scene blurred twisted became the interior of the jarre de the chiba empty red neon replicated to scratched infinity in the mirrored walls
CH03-P105,CH03,lonny zone stepped forward tall and cadaverous moving with the slow undersea grace of his addiction he stood alone among the square tables his hands in the pockets of his gray sharkskin slacks really man you re lookin very scattered the voice came from the braun speakers wintermute case said the pimp shrugged languidly and smiled where molly never you mind you re screwing up tonight case the flatline ringing bells all over freeside i think you do that man it outside the profile so tell me where she is and i ll call him off zone shook his head you keep too good track of your women can you case keep losin em one way or another i ll bring this thing down around your ears case said no you that kind man i know that you know something case i figure you ve got it figured out that it was me told deane to off that little cunt of yours in chiba case said taking an involuntary step toward the window but i what it matter though how much does it really matter to mr case quit kidding yourself i know your linda man i know all the lindas lindas are a generic product in my line of work know why she decided to rip you off love so you give a shit love wanna talk love she loved you i know that for the little she was worth she loved you you handle it she dead case fist glanced off the glass fuck up the hands man soon you punch deck zone vanished replaced by freeside night and the lights of the condos the braun shut off from the bed the phone bleated steadily case the flatline was waiting where you been i got it but it much the construct rattled off an address place had some weird ice around it for a nightclub that all i could get without leaving a calling card okay case said tell the hosaka to tell maelcum to disconnect the modem thanks dix a pleasure he sat on the bed for a long time savoring the new thing the treasure rage

CH03-P107,CH03,that level the cubicles bruce said after asking case to repeat the address for the eighth time he climbed back into the honda condensation dribbled from the hydrogen cell ex haust as the red fiberglass chassis swayed on chromed shocks you be long no saying but you ll wait we ll wait yeah he scratched his bare chest that last part of the address i think that a cubicle number forty three you expected lupus cath craned forward over bruce shoulder and peered up the drive had dried her hair not really case said that a problem just go down to the lowest level and find your friend cubicle if they let you in fine if they wanna see you she shrugged case turned and descended a spiral staircase of floral iron six turns and he reached a nightclub he paused and lit a yeheyuan looking over the tables freeside suddenly made sense to him biz he could feel it humming in the air this was it the local action not the high gloss facade of the rue jules verne but the real thing commerce the dance the crowd was mixed maybe half were tourists the other half residents of the islands downstairs he said to a passing waiter i want to go downstairs he showed his freeside chip the man gestured toward the rear of the club he walked quickly past the crowded tables hearing frag ments of half a dozen european languages as he passed i want a cubicle he said to the girl who sat at the low desk a terminal on her lap lower level he handed her his chip gender preference she passed the chip across a glass plate on the face of the terminal female he said automatically number thirty five phone if it satisfactory you can access our special services display beforehand if you like she smiled she returned his chip an elevator slid open behind her the corridor lights were blue case stepped out of the el evator and chose a direction at random numbered doors a hush like the halls of an expensive clinic he found his cubicle he been looking for molly now confused he raised his chip and placed it against a black sensor set directly beneath the number plate magnetic locks the sound reminded him of cheap hotel the girl sat up in bed and said something in german her eyes were soft and unblinking automatic pilot a neural cut out he backed out of the cubicle and closed the door the door of forty three was like all the others he hesitated the silence of the hallway said that the cubicles were sound proof it was pointless to try the chip he rapped his knuckles against enameled metal nothing the door seemed to absorb the sound he placed his chip against the black plate the bolts clicked she seemed to hit him somehow before he actually got ten the door open he was on his knees the steel door against his back the blades of her rigid thumbs quivering centimeters from his eyes jesus christ she said cuffing the side of his head as she rose you re an idiot to try that how the hell you open those locks case case you okay she leaned over him chip he said struggling for breath pain was spreading from his chest she helped him up and shoved him into the cubicle you bribe the help upstairs he shook his head and fell across the bed breathe in count one two three four hold it now out count he clutched his stomach you kicked me he managed shoulda been lower i wanna be alone i meditating right she sat beside him and getting a briefing she pointed at a small monitor set into the wall opposite the bed win termute telling me about straylight where the meat puppet there any that the most expensive special service of all she stood up she wore her leather jeans and a loose dark shirt the run tomorrow wintermute says what was that all about in the restaurant how come you ran cause if i stayed i might have killed riviera why what he did to me the show i get it this cost a lot she said extending her right hand as though it held an invisible fruit the five blades slid out then retracted smoothly costs to go to chiba costs to get the surgery costs to have them jack your nervous system up so you ll have the reflexes to go with the gear you know how i got the money when i was starting out here not here but a place like it in the sprawl joke to start with cause once they plant the cut out chip it seems like free money wake up sore sometimes but that it renting the goods is all you in when it all happening house has software for whatever a customer wants to pay for she cracked her knuckles fine i was getting my money trouble was the cut out and the circuitry the chiba clinics put in com patible so the worktime started bleeding in and i could re member it but it was just bad dreams and not all bad she smiled then it started getting strange she pulled his cigarettes from his pocket and lit one the house found out what i was doing with the money i had the blades in but the fine neuromotor work would take another three trips no way i was ready to give up puppet time she inhaled blew out a stream of smoke capping it with three perfect rings so the bastard who ran the place he had some custom software cooked up berlin that the place for snuff you know big market for mean kicks berlin i never knew who wrote the program they switched me to but it was based on all the classics they knew you were picking up on this stuff that you were conscious while you were working i conscious it like cyberspace but blank silver it smells like rain you can see yourself orgasm it like a little nova right out on the rim of space but i was starting to remember like dreams you know and they tell me they switched the software and started renting to specialty markets she seemed to speak from a distance and i knew but i kept quiet about it i needed the money the dreams got worse and worse and i tell myself that at least some of them were just dreams but by then i started to figure that the boss had a whole little clientele going for me nothing too good for molly the boss says and gives me this shit raise she shook her head that prick was charging eight times what he was paying me and he thought i know so what was he charging for bad dreams real ones one night one night i just come back from chiba she dropped the cigarette ground it out with her heel and sat down leaning against the wall surgeons went way in that trip tricky they must have disturbed the cut out chip i came up i was into this routine with a customer she dug her fingers deep in the foam senator he was knew his fat face right away we were both covered with blood we alone she was all she tugged at the temperfoam dead and that fat prick he was saying what wrong what wrong cause we finished yet she began to shake so i guess i gave the senator what he really wanted you know the shaking stopped she released the foam and ran her fingers back through her dark hair the house put a con tract out on me i had to hide for a while case stared at her so riviera hit a nerve last night she said i guess it wants me to hate him real bad so i ll be psyched up to go in there after him after him he already there straylight on the invitation of lady jane all that dedication shit she was there in a private box kinda case remembered the face he seen you gonna kill him she smiled cold he going to die yeah soon i had a visit too he said and told her about the window stumbling over what the zone figure had said about linda she nodded maybe it wants you to hate something too maybe i hate it maybe you hate yourself case
CH03-P108,CH03,how was it bruce asked as case climbed into the honda try it sometime he said rubbing his eyes just see you the kinda guy goes for the puppets cath said unhappily thumbing a fresh derm against her wrist can we go home now bruce asked sure drop me down jules verne where the bars are rue jules verne was a circumferential avenue looping the spindle midpoint while desiderata ran its length terminating at either end in the supports of the lado acheson light pumps if you turned right off desiderata and followed jules verne far enough you find yourself approaching desiderata from the left case watched bruce trike until it was out of sight then turned and walked past a vast brilliantly lit newsstand the covers of dozens of glossy japanese magazines presenting the faces of the month newest simstim stars directly overhead along the nighted axis the hologram sky glittered with fanciful constellations suggesting playing cards the faces of dice a top hat a martini glass the intersection of desiderata and jules verne formed a kind of gulch the balconied terraces of freeside cliff dwellers rising gradually to the grassy tablelands of another casino complex case watched a drone microlight bank gracefully in an updraft at the green verge of an artificial mesa lit for seconds by the soft glow of the invisible casino the thing was a kind of pilotless biplane of gossamer polymer its wings silkscreened to resemble a giant butterfly then it was gone beyond the mesa edge he seen a wink of reflected neon off glass either lenses or the turrets of lasers the drones were part of the spindle security system controlled by some central computer in straylight he walked on past bars named the hi lo the paradise le monde cricketeer shozoku smith emer gency he chose emergency because it was the smallest and most crowded but it took only seconds for him to realize that it was a tourist place no hum of biz here only a glazed sexual tension he thought briefly of the nameless club above molly rented cubicle but the image of her mirrored eyes fixed on the little screen dissuaded him what was wintermute revealing there now the ground plans of the villa straylight the history of the tessier ashpools he bought a mug of carlsberg and found a place against the wall closing his eyes he felt for the knot of rage the pure small coal of his anger it was there still where had it come from he remembered feeling only a kind of bafflement at his maiming in memphis nothing at all when he killed to defend his dealing interests in night city and a slack sickness and loathing after linda death under the inflated dome but no anger small and far away on the mind screen a semblance of deane struck a semblance of an office wall in an explosion of brains and blood he knew then the rage had come in the arcade when wintermute rescinded the simstim ghost of linda lee yanking away the simple animal promise of food warmth a place to sleep but he become aware of it until his exchange with the holo construct of lonny zone it was a strange thing he take its measure numb he said he been numb a long time years all his nights down ninsei his nights with linda numb in bed and numb at the cold sweating center of every drug deal but now he found this warm thing this chip of murder meat some part of him said it the meat talking ignore it gangster he opened his eyes cath stood beside him in a black shift her hair still wild from the ride in the honda thought you went home he said and covered his con fusion with a sip of carlsberg i got him to drop me off at this shop bought this she ran her palm across the fabric curve of the pelvic girdle he saw the blue derm on her wrist like it sure he automatically scanned the faces around them then looked back at her what do you think you re up to honey you like the beta you got off us lupus she was very close now radiating heat and tension eyes slitted over enor mous pupils and a tendon in her neck tense as a bowstring she was quivering vibrating invisibly with the fresh buzz you get off yeah but the comedown a bitch then you need another one and what that supposed to lead to i got a key up the hill behind the paradise just the cream iest crib people down the well on business tonight if you follow me if i follow you she took his hand between hers her palms hot and dry you re yak you lupus gaijin soldierman for the yakuza you got an eye huh he withdrew his hand and fumbled for a cigarette how come you got all your fingers then i thought you had to chop one off every time you screwed up i never screw up he lit his cigarette i saw that girl you re with day i met you walks like hideo scares me she smiled too widely i like that she like it with girls never said who hideo jane what she calls it

spread his fingers kneading the flesh beneath the thin black cloth she squirmed against him laughed oh you know she said lids half lowered in what must have been intended as a look of modesty she likes to party bruce and i we make the party circuit it gets real boring for her in there her old man lets her out sometimes as long as she brings hideo to take care of her where it get boring straylight they call it she told me oh it pretty all the pools and lilies it a castle a real castle all stone and sunsets she snuggled in against him hey lupus man you need a derm so we can be together she wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck thong her nails were bright pink against her boosted tan bitten to the quick she opened the purse and withdrew a paperbacked bub ble with a blue derm inside something white tumbled to the floor case stooped and picked it up an origami crane hideo gave it to me she said he tried to show me how but i ever get it right the necks come out backwards she tucked the folded paper back into her purse case watched as she tore the bubble away peeled the derm from its backing and smoothed it across his inner wrist jane she got a pointy face nose like a bird he watched his hands fumble an outline dark hair young i guess but she triff you know like all that money the drug hit him like an express train a white hot column of light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate illuminating the sutures of his skull with x rays of short cir cuited sexual energy his teeth sang in their individual sockets like tuning forks each one pitch perfect and clear as ethanol his bones beneath the hazy envelope of flesh were chromed and polished the joints lubricated with a film of silicone sand storms raged across the scoured floor of his skull generating waves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes spheres of purest crystal expanding come on she said taking his hand you got it now we got it up the hill we ll have it all night
CH03-P109,CH03,the anger was expanding relentless exponential riding out behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave a seismic fluid rich and corrosive his erection was a bar of lead the faces around them in emergency were painted doll things the pink and white of mouth parts moving moving words emerging like discrete balloons of sound he looked at cath and saw each pore in the tanned skin eyes flat as dumb glass a tint of dead metal a faint bloating the most minute asymmetries of breast and collarbone the something flared white behind his eyes he dropped her hand and stumbled for the door shoving someone out of the way fuck you she screamed behind him you ripoff shit he feel his legs he used them like stilts swaying crazily across the flagstone pavement of jules verne a distant rumbling in his ears his own blood razored sheets of light bisecting his skull at a dozen angles and then he was frozen erect fists tight against his thighs head back his lips curled shaking while he watched the loser zodiac of freeside the nightclub constellations of the hologram sky shift sliding fluid down the axis of darkness to swarm like live things at the dead center of reality until they had arranged themselves individually and in their hundreds to form a vast simple portrait stippled the ultimate mono chrome stars against night sky face of miss linda lee when he was able to look away to lower his eyes he found every other face in the street upraised the strolling tourists becalmed with wonder and when the lights in the sky went out a ragged cheer went up from jules verne to echo off the terraces and ranked balconies of lunar concrete somewhere a clock began to chime some ancient bell out of europe midnight
CH03-P110,CH03,he walked till morning the high wore away the chromed skeleton corroding hourly flesh growing solid the drug flesh replaced with the meat of his life he think he liked that very much to be conscious and unable to think he seemed to become each thing he saw a park bench a cloud of white moths around an antique streetlight a robot gardener striped diagonally with black and yellow a recorded dawn crept along the lado acheson system pink and lurid he forced himself to eat an omelette in a de siderata cafe to drink water to smoke the last of his cigarettes the rooftop meadow of the intercontinental was stirring as he crossed it an early breakfast crowd intent on coffee and crois sants beneath the striped umbrellas he still had his anger that was like being rolled in some alley and waking to discover your wallet still in your pocket untouched he warmed himself with it unable to give it a name or an object he rode the elevator down to his level fumbling in his pocket for the freeside credit chip that served as his key sleep was becoming real was something he might do to lie down on the sand colored temperfoam and find the blankness again they were waiting there the three of them their perfect white sportsclothes and stenciled tans setting off the handwoven organic chic of the furniture the girl sat on a wicker sofa an automatic pistol beside her on the leaf patterned print of the cushion turing she said you are under arrest
CH04-P111,CH04,your name is henry dorsett case she recited the year and place of his birth his bama single identification number and a string of names he gradually recognized as aliases from his past you been here awhile he saw the contents of his bag spread out across the bed unwashed clothing sorted by type the shuriken lay by itself between jeans and underwear on the sand tinted temperfoam where is kolodny the two men sat side by side on the couch their arms crossed over tanned chests identical gold chains slung around their necks case peered at them and saw that their youth was counterfeit marked by a certain telltale corrugation at the knuckles something the surgeons were un able to erase who kolodny that was the name in the register where is she i dunno he said crossing to the bar and pouring himself a glass of mineral water she took off where did you go tonight case the girl picked up the pistol and rested it on her thigh without actually pointing it at him jules verne couple of bars got high how about you his knees felt brittle the mineral water was warm and flat i think you grasp your situation said the man on the left taking a pack of gitanes from the breast pocket of his white mesh blouse you are busted mr case the charges have to do with conspiracy to augment an artificial intelli gence he took a gold dunhill from the same pocket and cradled it in his palm the man you call armitage is already in custody corto the man eyes widened yes how do you know that that is his name a millimeter of flame clicked from the lighter i forget case said you ll remember the girl said
CH04-P112,CH04,their names or worknames were michele roland and pierre pierre case decided would play the bad cop roland would take case side provide small kindnesses he found an unopened pack of yeheyuans when case refused a gitane and generally play counterpoint to pierre cold hostility michele would be the recording angel making occasional adjustments in the direction of the interrogation one or all of them he was certain would be kinked for audio very likely for simstim and anything he said or did now was admissible evidence evidence he asked himself through the grinding come down of what knowing that he follow their french they spoke freely among themselves or seemed to he caught enough as it was names like pauley armitage sense net panther mod erns protruding like icebergs from an animated sea of parisian french but it was entirely possible that the names were there for his benefit they always referred to molly as kolodny you say you were hired to make a run case roland said his slow speech intended to convey reasonableness and that you are unaware of the nature of the target is this not unusual in your trade having penetrated the defenses would you not be unable then to perform the required operation and surely an operation of some kind is required yes he leaned forward elbows on his stenciled brown knees palms out to receive case explanation pierre paced the room now he was by the window now by the door michele was the kink case decided her eyes never left him can i put some clothes on he asked pierre had insisted on stripping him searching the seams of his jeans now he sat naked on a wicker footstool with one foot obscenely white roland asked pierre something in french pierre at the window again was peering through a flat little pair of binoc ulars non he said absently and roland shrugged raising his eyebrows at case case decided it was a good time to smile roland returned the smile oldest cop bullshit in the book case thought look he said i sick had this godawful drug in a bar you know i wanna lie down you got me already you say you got armitage you got him go ask him i just hired help roland nodded and kolodny she was with armitage when he hired me just muscle a razorgirl far as i know which too far you know that armitage real name is corto pierre said his eyes still hidden by the soft plastic flanges of the binoculars how do you know that my friend i guess he mentioned it sometime case said regretting the slip everybody got a couple names your name pierre we know how you were repaired in chiba michele said and that may have been wintermute first mistake case stared at her as blankly as he could the name been mentioned before the process employed on you resulted in the clinic owner applying for seven basic patents do you know what that means no it means that the operator of a black clinic in chiba city now owns a controlling interest in three major medical research consortiums this reverses the usual order of things you see it attracted attention she crossed her brown arms across her small high breasts and settled back against the print cushion case wondered how old she might be people said that age always showed in the eyes but he never been able to see it julie deane had had the eyes of a disinterested ten year old behind the rose quartz of his glasses nothing old about michele but her knuckles traced you to the sprawl lost you again then caught up with you as you were leaving for istanbul we backtracked traced you through the grid determined that you instigated a riot at sense net sense net was eager to cooperate they ran an inventory for us they discovered that mccoy pauley rom personality construct was missing in istanbul roland said almost apologetically it was very easy the woman had alienated armitage contact with the secret police and then you came here pierre said slipping the bin oculars into his shorts pocket we were delighted chance to work on your tan you know what we mean michele said if you wish to pretend that you do not you only make things more difficult for yourself there is still the matter of extradition you will return with us case as will armitage but where exactly will we all be going to switzerland where you will be merely a pawn in the trial of an artificial intelligence or to le bama where you can be proven to have participated not only in data invasion and larceny but in an act of public mischief which cost fourteen innocent lives the choice is yours case took a yeheyuan from his pack pierre lit it for him with the gold dunhill would armitage protect you the question was punctuated by the lighter bright jaws snapping shut case looked up at him through the ache and bitterness of betaphenethylamine how old are you boss old enough to know that you are fucked burnt that this is over and you are in the way one thing case said and drew on his cigarette he blew the smoke up at the turing registry agent do you guys have any real jurisdiction out here i mean you have the freeside security team in on this party it their turf it he saw the dark eyes harden in the lean boy face and tensed for the blow but pierre only shrugged it matter roland said you will come with us we are at home with situations of legal ambiguity the treaties under which our arm of the registry operates grant us a great deal of flexibility and we create flexibility in situations where it is required the mask of amiability was down suddenly roland eyes as hard as pierre you are worse than a fool michele said getting to her feet the pistol in her hand you have no care for your species for thousands of years men dreamed of pacts with demons only now are such things possible and what would you be paid with what would your price be for aiding this thing to free itself and grow there was a knowing weariness in her young voice that no nineteen year old could have mustered you will dress now you will come with us along with the one you call armitage you will return with us to geneva and give testimony in the trial of this intelligence otherwise we kill you now she raised the pistol a smooth black walther with an integral silencer i dressing already he said stumbling toward the bed his legs were still numb clumsy he fumbled with a clean t shirt we have a ship standing by we will erase pauley con struct with a pulse weapon sense net ll be pissed case said thinking and all the evidence in the hosaka they are in some difficulty already for having owned such a thing case pulled the shirt over his head he saw the shuriken on the bed lifeless metal his star he felt for the anger it was gone time to give in to roll with it he thought of the toxin sacs here comes the meat he muttered in the elevator to the meadow he thought of molly she might already be in straylight hunting riviera hunted prob ably by hideo who was almost certainly the ninja clone of the finn story the one who come to retrieve the talking head he rested his forehead against the matte black plastic of a wall panel and closed his eyes his limbs were wood old warped and heavy with rain lunch was being served beneath the trees under the bright umbrellas roland and michele fell into character chattering brightly in french pierre came behind michele kept the muz zle of her pistol close to his ribs concealing the gun with a white duck jacket she draped over her arm
CH04-P113,CH04,crossing the meadow weaving between the tables and the trees he wondered if she would shoot him if he collapsed now black fur boiled at the borders of his vision he glanced up at the hot white band of the lado acheson armature and saw a giant butterfly banking gracefully against recorded sky at the edge of the meadow they came to railinged cliffside wild flowers dancing in the updraft from the canyon that was desiderata michele tossed her short dark hair and pointed saying something in french to roland she sounded genuinely happy case followed the direction of her gesture and saw the curve of planing lakes the white glint of casinos turquoise rectangles of a thousand pools the bodies of bathers tiny bronze hieroglyphs all held in serene approximation of gravity against the endless curve of freeside hull they followed the railing to an ornate iron bridge that arched over desiderata michele prodded him with the muzzle of the walther take it easy i hardly walk today they were a little over a quarter of the way across when the microlight struck its electric engine silent until the carbon fiber prop chopped away the top of pierre skull they were in the thing shadow for an instant case felt the hot blood spray across the back of his neck and then someone tripped him he rolled seeing michele on her back knees up aiming the walther with both hands that a waste of effort he thought with the strange lucidity of shock she was trying to shoot down the microlight and then he was running he looked back as he passed the first of the trees roland was running after him he saw the fragile biplane strike the iron railing of the bridge crumple cartwheel sweeping the girl with it down into desiderata roland looked back his face was fixed white his teeth bared he had something in his hand the gardening robot took roland as he passed that same tree it fell straight out of the groomed branches a thing like a crab diagonally striped with black and yellow you killed em case panted running crazy mother fucker you killed em all
CH04-P114,CH04,the little train shot through its tunnel at eighty kilometers per hour case kept his eyes closed the shower had helped but he lost his breakfast when he looked down and seen pierre blood washing pink across the white tiles gravity fell away as the spindle narrowed case stomach churned aerol was waiting with his scooter beside the dock case mon big problem the soft voice faint in his phones he chinned the volume control and peered into the lexan face plate of aerol helmet gotta get to garvey aerol yo strap in mon but garvey captive yacht came be fore she came back now she lockin steady on marcus garvey turing came before case climbed into the scooter frame and began to fasten the straps

CH04-P116,CH04,confused images of wasps and spiders rose in case mind as they came in sight of marcus garvey the little tug was snug against the gray thorax of a sleek insectile ship five times her length the arms of grapples stood out against garvey patched hull with the strange clarity of vacuum and raw sun light a pale corrugated gangway curved out of the yacht snaked sideways to avoid the tug engines and covered the aft hatch there was something obscene about the arrangement but it had more to do with ideas of feeding than of sex what happening with maelcum maelcum fine nobody come down the tube yacht pilot talk to him say relax as they swung past the gray ship case saw the name han iwa in crisp white capitals beneath an oblong cluster of jap anese i like this man i was thinking maybe it time we got our ass out of here anyway maelcum thinkin that precise thing mon but garvey not be goin far like that

CH04-P120,CH04,freefall the sensation was like diving through perfectly clear water she was falling rising through a wide tube of fluted lunar concrete lit at two meter intervals by rings of white neon the link was one way he talk to her he flipped
CH04-P121,CH04,boy that is one mean piece of software hottest thing since sliced bread that goddam thing invisible i just now rented twenty seconds on that little pink box four jumps left of the t a ice had a look at what we look like we we re not there case searched the matrix around the tessier ashpool ice until he found the pink structure a standard commercial unit and punched in closer to it maybe it defective maybe but i doubt it our baby military though and new it just register if it did we read as some kind of chinese sneak attack but nobody twigged to us at all maybe not even the folks in straylight
CH04-P122,CH04,case watched the blank wall that screened straylight well he said that an advantage right maybe the construct approximated laughter case winced at the sensation i checked ol kuang eleven out again for you boy it real friendly long as you re on the trigger end jus polite an helpful as can be speaks good english too you ever hear of slow virus before no i did once just an idea back then but that what ol kuang all about this bore and inject it more like we interface with the ice so slow the ice feel it the face of the kuang logics kinda sleazes up to the target and mutates so it gets to be exactly like the ice fabric then we lock on and the main programs cut in start talking circles round the logics in the ice we go siamese twin on em before they even get restless the flatline laughed wish you so damn jolly today man that laugh of yours sort of gets me in the spine too bad the flatline said ol dead man needs his laughs case slapped the simstim switch
CH04-P123,CH04,and crashed through tangled metal and the smell of dust the heels of his hands skidding as they struck slick paper something behind him collapsed noisily c on said the finn ease up a little case lay sprawled across a pile of yellowing magazines the girls shining up at him in the dimness of metro holografix a wistful galaxy of sweet white teeth he lay there until his heart had slowed breathing the smell of old magazines wintermute he said yeah said the finn somewhere behind him you got it fuck off case sat up rubbing his wrists come on said the finn stepping out of a sort of alcove in the wall of junk this way better for you man he took his partagas from a coat pocket and lit one the smell of cuban tobacco filled the shop you want i should come to you in the matrix like a burning bush you missing anything back there an hour here ll only take you a couple of seconds you ever think maybe it gets on my nerves you coming on like people i know he stood swatting pale dust from the front of his black jeans he turned glaring back at the dusty shop windows the closed door to the street what out there new york or does it just stop well said the finn it like that tree you know falls in the woods but maybe there nobody to hear it he showed case his huge front teeth and puffed his cigarette you can go for a walk you wanna it all there or anyway all the parts of it you ever saw this is memory right i tap you sort it out and feed it back in i have this good a memory case said looking around he looked down at his hands turning them over he tried to remember what the lines on his palms were like but everybody does the finn said dropping his cigarette and grinding it out under his heel but not many of you can access it artists can mostly if they re any good if you could lay this construct over the reality the finn place in lower man hattan you see a difference but maybe not as much as you think memory holographic for you the finn tugged at one of his small ears i different how do you mean holographic the word made him think of riviera the holographic paradigm is the closest thing you ve worked out to a representation of human memory is all but you ve never done anything about it people i mean the finn stepped forward and canted his streamlined skull to peer up at case maybe if you had i be happening what that supposed to mean the finn shrugged his tattered tweed was too wide across the shoulders and quite settle back into position i trying to help you case why because i need you the large yellow teeth appeared again and because you need me bullshit can you read my mind finn he grimaced wintermute i mean minds read see you ve still got the paradigms print gave you and you re barely print literate i can access your memory but that not the same as your mind he reached into the exposed chassis of an ancient television and withdrew a silver black vacuum tube see this part of my dna sort of he tossed the thing into the shadows and case heard it pop and tinkle you re always building models stone circles cathedrals pipe organs adding machines i got no idea why i here now you know that but if the run goes off tonight you ll have finally managed the real thing i know what you re talking about that you in the collective your species you killed those turings the finn shrugged hadda hadda you should give a shit they woulda offed you and never thought twice anyway why i got you here we gotta talk more remember this and his right hand held the charred wasps nest from case dream reek of fuel in the closeness of the darkshop case stumbled back against a wall of junk yeah that was me did it with the holo rig in the window another memory i tapped out of you when i flatlined you that first time know why it im portant case shook his head because and the nest somehow was gone it the closest thing you got to what tessier ashpool would like to be the human equivalent straylight s like that nest or anyway it was supposed to work out that way l figure it ll make you feel better feel better to know what they re like you were starting to hate my guts for a while there that good but hate them instead same difference listen case said stepping forward they never did shit to me you it different but he feel the anger so t a they made me the french girl she said you were selling out the species demon she said i was the finn grinned it much matter you gotta hate somebody before this is over he turned and headed for the back of the shop well come on i ll show you a little bit of straylight while i got you here he lifted the corner of the blanket white light poured out shit man just stand there case followed rubbing his face
CH04-P124,CH04,okay said the finn and grabbed his elbow they were drawn past the stale wool in a puff of dust into freefall and a cylindrical corridor of fluted lunar concrete ringed with white neon at two meter intervals jesus case said tumbling this is the front entrance the finn said his tweed flap ping if this a construct of mine where the shop is would be the main gate up by the freeside axis this ll all be a little low on detail though because you have the memories except for this bit here you got off molly case managed to straighten out but began to corkscrew in a long spiral hold on the finn said i ll fast forward us the walls blurred dizzying sensation of headlong move ment colors whipping around corners and through narrow corridors they seemed at one point to pass through several meters of solid wall a flash of pitch darkness here the finn said this is it they floated in the center of a perfectly square room walls and ceiling paneled in rectangular sections of dark wood the floor was covered by a single square of brilliant carpet patterned after a microchip circuits traced in blue and scarlet wool in the exact center of the room aligned precisely with the carpet pattern stood a square pedestal of frosted white glass the villa straylight said a jeweled thing on the pedestal in a voice like music is a body grown in upon itself a gothic folly each space in straylight is in some way secret this endless series of chambers linked by passages by stairwells vaulted like intestines where the eye is trapped in narrow curves carried past ornate screens empty alcoves essay of jane the finn said producing his partagas wrote that when she was twelve semiotics course the architects of freeside went to great pains to conceal the fact that the interior of the spindle is arranged with the banal precision of furniture in a hotel room in straylight the hull inner surface is overgrown with a desperate proliferation of structures forms flowing interlocking rising toward a solid core of microcircuitry our clan corporate heart a cylinder of silicon wormholed with narrow maintenance tunnels some no wider than a man hand the bright crabs burrow there the drones alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage
CH04-P125,CH04,that was her you saw in the restaurant the finn said by the standards of the archipelago the head continued ours is an old family the convolutions of our home reflecting that age but reflecting something else as well the semiotics of the villa bespeak a turning in a denial of the bright void beyond the hull tessier and ashpool climbed the well of gravity to discover that they loathed space they built freeside to tap the wealth of the new islands grew rich and eccentric and began the construction of an extended body in straylight we have sealed ourselves away behind our money growing inward generating a seamless universe of self the villa straylight knows no sky recorded or otherwise at the villa silicon core is a small room the only rec tilinear chamber in the complex here on a plain pedestal of glass rests an ornate bust platinum and cloisonne studded with lapis and pearl the bright marbles of its eyes were cut from the synthetic ruby viewport of the ship that brought the first tessier up the well and returned for the first ashpool the head fell silent well case asked finally almost expecting the thing to answer him that all she wrote the finn said finish it just a kid then this thing a ceremonial terminal sort of i need molly in here with the right word at the right time that the catch mean shit how deep you and the flatline ride that chinese virus if this thing hear the magic word so what the word i know you might say what i am is basically defined by the fact that i know because i know i am that which knoweth not the word if you knew man and told me i know it hardwired in someone else has to learn it and bring it here just when you and the flatline punch through that ice and scramble the cores what happens then i exist after that i cease okay by me case said sure but you watch your ass case my ah other lobe is on to us it looks like one burning bush looks pretty much like another and armitage is starting to go what that mean but the paneled room folded itself through a dozen impos sible angles tumbling away into cyberspace like an origami crane
CH04-P126,CH04,you tryin to break my record son the flatline asked you were braindead again five seconds sit tight case said and hit the simstim switch she crouched in darkness her palms against rough concrete case case case case the digital display pulsed his name in alphanumerics wintermute informing her of the link cute she said she rocked back on her heels and rubbed her palms together cracked her knuckles what kept you time molly time now she pressed her tongue hard against her lower front teeth one moved slightly activating her microchannel amps the random bounce of photons through the darkness was converted to a pulse of electrons the concrete around her coming up ghost pale and grainy okay honey now we go out to play her hiding place proved to be a service tunnel of some kind she crawled out through a hinged ornate grill of tarnished brass he saw enough of her arms and hands to know that she wore the polycarbon suit again under the plastic he felt the familiar tension of thin tight leather there was something slung under her arm in a harness or holster she stood up unzipped the suit and touched the checkered plastic of a pistolgrip hey case she said barely voicing the words you lis tening tell you a story had me this boy once you kinda remind me she turned and surveyed the corridor johnny his name was the low vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum cases archaic looking glass fronted boxes made of brown wood they looked awkward there against the organic curves of the hallway walls as though they been brought in and set up in a line for some forgotten purpose dull brass fixtures held globes of white light at ten meter intervals the floor was uneven and as she set off along the corridor case realized that hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at random in some places they were six deep the floor a soft patchwork of handwoven wool molly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents which irritated him he had to satisfy himself with her disin terested glances which gave him fragments of pottery antique weapons a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it was unrecognizable frayed sections of tapestry my johnny see he was smart real flash boy started out as a stash on memory lane chips in his head and people paid to hide data there had the yak after him night i met him and i did for their assassin more luck than anything else but i did for him and after that it was tight and sweet case her lips barely moved he felt her form the words he need to hear them spoken aloud we had a set up with a squid so we could read the traces of everything he ever stored ran it all out on tape and started twisting selected clients ex clients i was bagman muscle watchdog i was real happy you ever been happy case he was my boy we worked together partners i was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house when i met him she paused edged around a sharp turn and continued more of the glossy wooden cases their sides a color that reminded him of cockroach wings tight sweet just ticking along we were like nobody could ever touch us i going to let them yakuza i guess they still wanted johnny ass cause i killed their man cause johnny burned them and the yak they can afford to move so fucking slow man they ll wait years and years give you a whole life just so you ll have more to lose when they come and take it away patient like a spider zen spiders i know that then or if i did i figured it apply to us like when you re young you figure you re unique i was young then they came when we were thinking we maybe had enough to be able to quit pack it in go to europe maybe not that either of us knew what we do there with nothing to do but we were living fat swiss orbital ac counts and a crib full of toys and furniture takes the edge off your game so that first one they sent he been hot reflexes like you never saw implants enough style for ten ordinary hoods but the second one he was i dunno like a monk cloned stone killer from the cells on up had it in him death this silence he gave it off in a cloud her voice trailed off as the corridor split identical stairwells descending she took the left one time i was a little kid we were squatting it was down by the hudson and those rats man they were big it the chemicals get into them big as i was and all night one had been scrabbling under the floor of the squat round dawn somebody brought this old man in seams down his cheeks and his eyes all red had a roll of greasy leather like you keep steel tools in to keep the rust off spread it out had this old revolver and three shells old man he puts one bullet in there then he starts walking up and down the squat we re hanging back by the walls back and forth got his arms crossed head down like he forgotten the gun listening for the rat we got real quiet old man takes a step rat moves rat moves he takes another step an hour of that then he seems to remember his gun points it at the floor grins and pulls the trigger rolled it back up and left i crawled under there later rat had a hole between its eyes she was watching the sealed doorways that opened at intervals along the corridor the second one the one who came for johnny he was like that old man not old but he was like that he killed that way the corridor widened the sea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous can delabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the floor crystal tinkled as molly entered the hall third door left blinked the readout she turned left avoiding the inverted tree of crystal i just saw him once on my way into our place he was coming out we lived in a converted factory space lots of young comers from sense net like that pretty good security to start with and i put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight i knew johnny was up there but this little guy he caught my eye as he was coming out say a word we just looked at each other and i knew plain little guy plain clothes no pride in him humble he looked at me and got into a pedicab i knew went upstairs and johnny was sitting in a chair by the window with his mouth a little open like he just thought of something to say the door in front of her was old a carved slab of thai teak that seemed to have been sawn in half to fit the low doorway a primitive mechanical lock with a stainless face had been inset beneath a swirling dragon she knelt drew a tight little roll of black chamois from an inside pocket and selected a needle thin pick never much found anybody i gave a damn about after that she inserted the pick and worked in silence nibbling at her lower lip she seemed to rely on touch alone her eyes unfo cused and the door was a blur of blond wood case listened to the silence of the hall punctuated by the soft clink of the candelabrum candles straylight was all wrong he remem bered cath story of a castle with pools and lilies and jane mannered words recited musically by the head a place grown in upon itself straylight smelled faintly musty faintly per fumed like a church where were the tessier ashpools he expected some clean hive of disciplined activity but molly had seen no one her monologue made him uneasy she never told him that much about herself before aside from her story in the cubicle she seldom said anything that had even in dicated that she had a past she closed her eyes and there was a click that case felt rather than heard it made him remember the magnetic locks on the door of her cubicle in the puppet place the door had opened for him even though he had the wrong chip that was wintermute manipulating the lock the way it had manip ulated the drone micro and the robot gardener the lock system in the puppet place had been a subunit of freeside security system the simple mechanical lock here would pose a real problem for the ai requiring either a drone of some kind or a human agent she opened her eyes put the pick back into the chamois carefully rerolled it and tucked it back into its pocket guess you re kinda like he was she said think you re born to run figure what you were into back in chiba that was a stripped down version of what you be doing anywhere bad luck it ll do that sometimes get you down to basics she stood stretched shook herself you know i figure the one tessier ashpool sent after that jimmy the boy who stole the head he must be pretty much the same as the one the yak sent to kill johnny she drew the fletcher from its holster and dialed the barrel to full auto the ugliness of the door struck case as she reached for it not the door itself which was beautiful or had once been part of some more beautiful whole but the way it had been sawn down to fit a particular entrance even the shape was wrong a rectangle amid smooth curves of polished concrete they imported these things he thought and then forced it all to fit but none of it fit the door was like the awkward cabinets the huge crystal tree then he remembered jane essay and imagined that the fittings had been hauled up the well to flesh out some master plan a dream long lost in the compulsive effort to fill space to replicate some family image of self he remembered the shattered nest the eyeless things writhing molly grasped one of the carved dragon forelegs and the door swung open easily the room behind was small cramped little more than a closet gray steel tool cabinets were backed against a curving wall a light fixture had come on automatically she closed the door behind her and went to the ranged lockers third left pulsed the optic chip wintermute overriding her time display five down but she opened the top drawer first it was no more than a shallow tray empty the second was empty as well the third which was deeper contained dull beads of solder and a small brown thing that looked like a human fingerbone the fourth drawer held a damp swollen copy of an obsolete technical manual in french and japanese in the fifth behind the armored gauntlet of a heavy vacuum suit she found the key it was like a dull brass coin with a short hollow tube braised against one edge she turned it slowly in her hand and case saw that the interior of the tube was lined with studs and flanges the letters chubb were molded across one face of the coin the other was blank he told me she whispered wintermute how he played a waiting game for years have any real power then but he could use the villa security and custodial systems to keep track of where everything was how things moved where they went he saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago and he managed to get somebody else to leave it here then he killed him the boy who brought it here kid was eight she closed her white fingers over the key so nobody would find it she took a length of black nylon cord from the suit kangaroo pocket and threaded it through the round hole above chubb knotting it she hung it around her neck they were always fucking him over with how old fashioned they were he said all their nineteenth century stuff he looked just like the finn on the screen in that meat puppet hole almost thought he was the finn if i careful her readout flared the time alphanumerics superimposed over the gray steel chests he said if they turned into what they wanted to he could ve gotten out a long time ago but they screwed up freaks like jane that what he called her but he talked like he liked her she turned opened the door and stepped out her hand brushing the checkered grip of the holstered fletcher case flipped

CH04-P129,CH04,molly was trotting along a length of corridor that might have been the one she traveled before the glass fronted cases were gone now and case decided they were moving toward the tip of the spindle gravity was growing weaker soon she was bounding smoothly over rolling hillocks of carpets faint twinges in her leg the corridor narrowed suddenly curved split she turned right and started up a freakishly steep flight of stairs her leg beginning to ache overhead strapped and bun dled cables hugged the stairwell ceiling like colorcoded gan glia the walls were splotched with damp she arrived at a triangular landing and stood rubbing her leg more corridors narrow their walls hung with rugs they branched away in three directions left she shrugged lemme look around okay left relax there time she started down the corridor that led off to her right stop go back danger she hesitated from the half open oak door at the far end of the passage came a voice loud and slurred like the voice of a drunk case thought the language might be french but it was too indistinct molly took a step another her hand sliding into the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher when she stepped into the neural disruptor field her ears rang a tiny rising tone that made case think of the sound of her fletcher she pitched forward her striated muscles slack and struck the door with her forehead she twisted and lay on her back her eyes unfocused breath gone what this said the slurred voice fancy dress a trem bling hand entered the front of her suit and found the fletcher tugging it out come visit child now she got up slowly her eyes fixed on the muzzle of a black automatic pistol the man hand was steady enough now the gun barrel seemed to be attached to her throat with a taut invisible string he was old very tall and his features reminded case of the girl he had glimpsed in the vingtieme siecle he wore a heavy robe of maroon silk quilted around the long cuffs and shawl collar one foot was bare the other in a black velvet slipper with an embroidered gold foxhead over the instep he motioned her into the room slow darling the room was very large cluttered with an assortment of things that made no sense to case he saw a gray steel rack of old fashioned sony monitors a wide brass bed heaped with sheepskins with pil lows that seemed to have been made from the kind of rug used to pave the corridors molly eyes darted from a huge tele funken entertainment console to shelves of antique disk re cordings their crumbling spines cased in clear plastic to a wide worktable littered with slabs of silicon case registered the cyberspace deck and the trodes but her glance slid over it without pausing it would be customary the old man said for me to kill you now case felt her tense ready for a move but tonight i indulge myself what is your name molly molly mine is ashpool he sank back into the creased softness of a huge leather armchair with square chrome legs but the gun never wavered he put her fletcher on a brass table beside the chair knocking over a plastic vial of red pills the table was thick with vials bottles of liquor soft plastic en velopes spilling white powders case noticed an old fashioned glass hypodermic and a plain steel spoon how do you cry molly i see your eyes are walled away i curious his eyes were red rimmed his forehead gleaming with sweat he was very pale sick case decided or drugs i cry much but how would you cry if someone made you cry i spit she said the ducts are routed back into my mouth then you ve already learned an important lesson for one so young he rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and took a bottle from the table beside him without bothering to choose from the half dozen different liquors he drank brandy a trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his mouth that is the way to handle tears he drank again i busy tonight molly i built all this and now i busy dying i could go out the way i came she said he laughed a harsh high sound you intrude on my suicide and then ask to simply walk out really you amaze me a thief it my ass boss and it all i got i just wanna get it out of here in one piece you are a very rude girl suicides here are conducted with a degree of decorum that what i doing you understand but perhaps i ll take you with me tonight down to hell it would be very egyptian of me he drank again come here then he held out the bottle his hand shaking drink she shook her head it poisoned he said but returned the brandy to the table sit sit on the floor we ll talk what about she sat case felt the blades move very slightly beneath her nails whatever comes to mind my mind it my party the cores woke me twenty hours ago something was afoot they said and l was needed were you the something molly surely they need me to handle you no something else but i been dreaming you see for thirty years you born when last i lay me down to sleep they told us we dream in that cold they told us we never feel cold either madness molly lies of course i dreamed the cold let the outside in that was it the outside all the night i built this to hide us from just a drop at first one grain of night seeping in drawn by the cold others following it filling my head the way rain fills an empty pool calla lilies i remember the pools were terracotta nursemaids all of chrome how the limbs went winking through the gardens at sunset i old molly over two hundred years if you count the cold the cold the barrel of the pistol snapped up suddenly quivering the ten dons in her thighs were drawn tight as wires now you can get freezerburn she said carefully nothing burns there he said impatiently lowering the gun his few movements were increasingly sclerotic his head nodded it cost him an effort to stop it nothing burns i remember now the cores told me our intelligences are mad and all the billions we paid so long ago when artificial intelligences were rather a racy concept i told the cores i deal with it bad timing really with jean down in melbourne and only our sweet jane minding the store or very good timing perhaps would you know molly the gun rose again there are some odd things afoot now in the villa straylight boss she asked him you know wintermute a name yes to conjure with perhaps a lord of hell surely in my time dear molly i have known many lords and not a few ladies why a queen of spain once in that very bed but i wander he coughed wetly the muzzle of the pistol jerking as he convulsed he spat on the carpet near his one bare foot how i do wander through the cold but soon no more i ordered a jane thawed when i woke strange to lie every few decades with what legally amounts to one own daughter his gaze swept past her to the rack of blank monitors he seemed to shiver marie france eyes he said faintly and smiled we cause the brain to become allergic to certain of its own neurotransmitters resulting in a peculiarly pliable imitation of autism his head swayed sideways re covered i understand that the effect is now more easily ob tained with an embedded microchip the pistol slid from his fingers bounced on the carpet the dreams grow like slow ice he said his face was tinged with blue his head sank back into the waiting leather and he began to snore up she snatched the gun she stalked the room ashpool automatic in her hand a vast quilt or comforter was heaped beside the bed in a broad puddle of congealed blood thick and shiny on the pat terned rugs twitching a corner of the quilt back she found the body of a girl white shoulder blades slick with blood her throat had been slit the triangular blade of some sort of scraper glinted in the dark pool beside her molly knelt careful to avoid the blood and turned the dead girl face to the light the face case had seen in the restaurant there was a click deep at the very center of things and the world was frozen molly simstim broadcast had become a still frame her fingers on the girl cheek the freeze held for three seconds and then the dead face was altered became the face of linda lee another click and the room blurred molly was standing looking down at a golden laser disk beside a small console on the marble top of a bedside table a length of fiberoptic ribbon ran like a leash from the console to a socket at the base of the slender neck i got your number fucker case said feeling his own lips moving somewhere far away he knew that wintermute had altered the broadcast molly seen the dead girl face swirl like smoke to take on the outline of linda deathmask molly turned she crossed the room to ashpool chair the man breathing was slow and ragged she peered at the litter of drugs and alcohol she put his pistol down picked up her fletcher dialed the barrel over to single shot and very carefully put a toxin dart through the center of his closed left eyelid he jerked once breath halting in mid intake his other eye brown and fathomless opened slowly it was still open when she turned and left the room

CH04-P131,CH04,the perspective startled him molly was crouching between steel girders twenty meters above a broad stained floor of polished concrete the room was a hangar or service bay he could see three spacecraft none larger than garvey and all in various stages of repair japanese voices a figure in an orange jumpsuit stepped from a gap in the hull of a bulbous construc tion vehicle and stood beside one of the thing piston driven weirdly anthropomorphic arms the man punched something into a portable console and scratched his ribs a cartlike red drone rolled into sight on gray balloon tires case flashed her chip hey she said waiting for a guide she settled back on her haunches the arms and knees of her modern suit the color of the blue gray paint on the girders her leg hurt a sharp steady pain now i shoulda gone back to chin she muttered something came ticking quietly out of the shadows on a level with her left shouder it paused swayed its spherical body from side to side on high arched spider legs fired a micro second burst of diffuse laserlight and froze it was a braun microdrone and case had once owned the same model a pointless accessory he obtained as part of a package deal with a cleveland hardware fence it looked like a stylized matte black daddy longlegs a red led began to pulse at the sphere equator its body was no larger than a baseball okay she said i hear you she stood up favoring her left leg and watched the little drone reverse it picked its methodical way back across its girder and into darkness she turned and looked back at the service area the man in the orange jumpsuit was sealing the front of a white vacuum rig she watched him ring and seal the helmet pick up his console and step back through the gap in the construction boat hull there was a rising whine of motors and the thing slid smoothly out of sight on a ten meter circle of flooring that sank away into a harsh glare of arc lamps the red drone waited patiently at the edge of the hole left by the elevator panel then she was off after the braun threading her way between a forest of welded steel struts the braun winked its led steadily beckoning her on how you doin case you back in garvey with maelcum sure and jacked into this i like it you know like i ve always talked to myself in my head when i ve been in tight spots pretend i got some friend somebody i can trust and i ll tell em what i really think what i feel like and then i ll pretend they re telling me what they think about that and i ll just go along that way having you in is kinda like that that scene with ashpool she gnawed at her lower lip swinging around a strut keeping the drone in sight i was expecting something maybe a little less gone you know i mean these guys are all batshit in here like they got luminous messages scrawled across the inside of their foreheads or something i like the way it looks i like the way it smells the drone was hoisting itself up a nearly invisible ladder of u shaped steel rungs toward a narrow dark opening and while i feeling confessional baby i gotta admit maybe i never much expected to make it out of this one anyway been on this bad roll for a while and you re the only good change come down since i signed on with armitage she looked up at the black circle the drone led winked climbing not that you re all that shit hot she smiled but it was gone too quickly and she gritted her teeth at the stabbing pain in her leg as she began to climb the ladder continued up through a metal tube barely wide enough for her shoulders she was climbing up out of gravity toward the weightless axis her chip pulsed the time it had been a long day the clarity of her sensorium cut the bite of the betaphenethylamine but case could still feel it he preferred the pain in her leg

CH04-P145,CH04,by the chip in her optic nerve case had been following her progress through villa straylight for over an hour letting the endorphin analog she taken blot out his hangover the pain in her leg was gone she seemed to move through a warm bath the braun drone was perched on her shoulder its tiny manipulators like padded surgical clips se cure in the polycarbon of the modern suit the walls here were raw steel striped with rough brown ribbons of epoxy where some kind of covering had been ripped away she hidden from a work crew crouching the fletcher cradled in her hands her suit steel gray while the two slender africans and their balloon tired workcart passed the men had shaven heads and wore orange coveralls one was singing softly to himself in a language case had never heard the tones and melody alien and haunting the head speech jane essay on straylight came back to him as she worked her way deeper into the maze of the place straylight was crazy was craziness grown in the resin concrete they mixed from pulverized lunar stone grown in welded steel and tons of knick knacks all the bizarre impe dimentia they shipped up the well to line their winding nest but it a craziness he understood not like armitage madness which he now imagined he could understand twist a man far enough then twist him as far back in the opposite direction reverse and twist again the man broke like break ing a length of wire and history had done that for colonel corto history had already done the really messy work when wintermute found him sifting him out of all of the war ripe detritus gliding into the man flat gray field of consciousness like a water spider crossing the face of some stagnant pool the first messages blinking across the face of a child micro in a darkened room in a french asylum wintermute had built armitage up from scratch with corto memories of screaming fist as the foundation but armitage memories have been corto after a certain point case doubted if ar mitage had recalled the betrayal the nightwings whirling down in flame armitage had been a sort of edited version of corto and when the stress of the run had reached a certain point the armitage mechanism had crumbled corto had sur faced with his guilt and his sick fury and now corto armitage was dead a small frozen moon for freeside he thought of the toxin sacs old ashpool was dead too drilled through the eye with molly microscopic dart deprived of whatever expert overdose he mixed for himself that was a more puzzling death ashpool the death of a mad king and he killed the puppet he called his daughter the one with jane face it seemed to case as he rode molly broad cast sensory input through the corridors of straylight that he never really thought of anyone like ashpool anyone as pow erful as he imagined ashpool had been as human power in case world meant corporate power the zai batsus the multinationals that shaped the course of human history had transcended old barriers viewed as organisms they had attained a kind of immortality you kill a zaibatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives there were others waiting to step up the ladder assume the vacated po sition access the vast banks of corporate memory but tessier ashpool like that and he sensed the difference in the death of its founder t a was an atavism a clan he remem bered the litter of the old man chamber the soiled humanity of it the ragged spines of the old audio disks in their paper sleeves one foot bare the other in a velvet slipper the braun plucked at the hood of the modern suit and molly turned left through another archway wintermute and the nest phobic vision of the hatching wasps time lapse machine gun of biology but the zaibatsus more like that or the yakuza hives with cybernetic memories vast single organisms their dna coded in silicon if straylight was an expression of the corporate identity of tessier ashpool then t a was crazy as the old man had been the same ragged tangle of fears the same strange sense of aimlessness if they turned into what they wanted to he remembered molly saying but wintermute had told her they case had always taken it for granted that the real bosses the kingpins in a given industry would be both more and less than people he seen it in the men who crippled him in memphis he seen wage affect the semblance of it in night city and it had allowed him to accept armitage flatness and lack of feeling he always imagined it as a gradual and willing accommodation of the machine the system the parent or ganism it was the root of street cool too the knowing posture that implied connection invisible lines up to hidden levels of influence but what was happening now in the corridors of villa straylight whole stretches were being stripped back to steel and con crete wonder where our peter is now huh maybe see that boy soon she muttered and armitage where he case dead he said knowing she hear him he dead he flipped
CH04-P146,CH04,the chinese program was face to face with the target ice rainbow tints gradually dominated by the green of the rectangle representing the t a cores arches of emerald across the col orless void how it go dixie fine too slick thing amazing shoulda had one that time in singapore did the old new bank of asia for a good fiftieth of what they were worth but that ancient history this baby takes all the drudgery out of it makes you wonder what a real war would be like now if this kinda shit was on the street we be out a job case said you wish wait ll you re steering that thing upstairs through black ice sure something small and decidedly nongeometric had just ap peared on the far end of one of the emerald arches dixie yeah i see it know if i believe it a brownish dot a dull gnat against the green wall of the t a cores it began to advance across the bridge built by kuang grade mark eleven and case saw that it was walking as it came the green section of the arch extended the poly chrome of the virus program rolling back a few steps ahead of the cracked black shoes gotta hand it to you boss the flatline said when the short rumpled figure of the finn seemed to stand a few meters away i never seen anything this funny when i was alive but the eerie nonlaugh come i never tried it before the finn said showing his teeth his hands bunched in the pockets of his frayed jacket you killed armitage case said corto yeah armitage was already gone hadda do it i know i know you wanna get the enzyme okay no sweat i was the one gave it to armitage in the first place i mean i told him what to use but i think maybe it better to let the deal stand you got enough time i ll give it to you only a coupla hours now right case watched blue smoke billow in cyberspace as the finn lit up one of his partagas you guys the finn said you re a pain the flatline here if you were all like him it would be real simple he a construct just a buncha rom so he always does what i expect him to my projections said there much chance of molly wandering in on ashpool big exit scene give you one ex ample he sighed why he kill himself case asked why anybody kill himself the figure shrugged i guess i know if anybody does but it would take me twelve hours to explain the various factors in his history and how they in terrelate he was ready to do it for a long time but he kept going back into the freezer christ he was a tedious old fuck the finn face wrinkled with disgust it all tied in with why he killed his wife mainly you want the short reason but what sent him over the edge for good and all little jane figured a way to fiddle the program that controlled his cryogenic sys tem subtle too so basically she killed him except he figured he killed himself and your friend the avenging angel figures she got him with an eyeball full of shellfish juice the finn flicked his butt away into the matrix below well actually i guess i did give jane the odd hint a little of the old how to you know wintermute case said choosing the words carefully you told me you were just a part of something else later on you said you exist if the run goes off and molly gets the word into the right slot the finn streamlined skull nodded okay then who we gonna be dealing with then if ar mitage is dead and you re gonna be gone just who exactly is going to tell me how to get these fucking toxin sacs out of my system who going to get molly back out of there i mean where where exactly are all our asses gonna be we cut you loose from the hardwiring the finn took a wooden toothpick from his pocket and regarded it critically like a surgeon examining a scalpel good question he said finally you know salmon kinda fish these fish see they re compelled to swim upstream got it no case said well i under compulsion myself and i know why if i were gonna subject you to my very own thoughts let call em speculations on the topic it would take a couple of your lifetimes because i ve given it a lot of thought and i just know but when this is over we do it right i gonna be part of something bigger much bigger the finn glanced up and around the matrix but the parts of me that are me now that ll still be here and you ll get your payoff case fought back an insane urge to punch himself forward and get his fingers around the figure throat just above the ragged knot in the rusty scarf his thumbs deep in the finn larynx well good luck the finn said he turned hands in pock ets and began trudging back up the green arch hey asshole the flatline said when the finn had gone a dozen paces the figure paused half turned what about me what about my payoff you ll get yours it said what that mean case asked as he watched the narrow tweed back recede i wanna be erased the construct said i told you that remember
CH04-P147,CH04,straylight reminded case of deserted early morning shop ping centers he known as a teenager low density places where the small hours brought a fitful stillness a kind of numb expectancy a tension that left you watching insects swarm around caged bulbs above the entrance of darkened shops fringe places just past the borders of the sprawl too far from the all night click and shudder of the hot core there was that same sense of being surrounded by the sleeping inhabitants of a waking world he had no interest in visiting or knowing of dull business temporarily suspended of futility and repetition soon to wake again molly had slowed now either knowing that she was nearing her goal or out of concern for her leg the pain was starting to work its jagged way back through the endorphins and he sure what that meant she speak kept her teeth clenched and carefully regulated her breathing she passed many things that case understood but his curiosity was gone there had been a room filled with shelves of books a million flat leaves of yellowing paper pressed between bindings of cloth or leather the shelves marked at intervals by labels that followed a code of letters and numbers a crowded gallery where case had stared through molly incurious eyes at a shattered dust stenciled sheet of glass a thing labeled her gaze had tracked the brass plaque automatically la mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires meme she reached out and touched this her artificial nails clicking against the lexan sand wich protecting the broken glass there had been what was obviously the entrance to tessier ashpool cryogenic com pound circular doors of black glass trimmed with chrome she seen no one since the two africans and their cart and for case they taken on a sort of imaginary life he pictured them gliding gently through the halls of straylight their smooth dark skulls gleaming nodding while the one still sang his tired little song and none of this was anything like the villa stray light he would have expected some cross between cath fairy tale castle and a half remembered childhood fantasy of the yakuza inner sanctum one and a half hours case she said i wanna favor stiffly she lowered herself to sit on a stack of polished steel plates the finish of each plate protected by an uneven coating of clear plastic she picked at a rip in the plastic on the topmost plate blades sliding from beneath thumb and forefinger leg not good you know figure any climb like that and the endorphin cut it much longer so maybe just maybe right i got a prob lem here what it is if i buy it here before riviera does and she stretched her leg kneaded the flesh of her thigh through modern polycarbon and paris leather i want you to tell him tell him it was me got it just say it was molly he ll know okay she glanced around the empty hallway the bare walls the floor here was raw lunar concrete and the air smelled of resins shit man i even know if you re listening case she winced got to her feet nodded what he told you man wintermute he tell you about marie france she was the tessier half jane genetic mother and of that dead puppet of ashpool i guess figure why he tell me down in that cubicle lotta stuff why he has to come on like the finn or somebody he told me that it not just a mask it like he uses real profiles as valves gears himself down to communicate with us called it a template model of per sonality she drew her fletcher and limped away down the corridor the bare steel and scabrous epoxy ended abruptly replaced by what case at first took to be a rough tunnel blasted from solid rock molly examined its edge and he saw that in fact the steel was sheathed with panels of something that looked and felt like cold stone she knelt and touched the dark sand spread across the floor of the imitation tunnel it felt like sand cool and dry but when she drew her finger through it it closed like a fluid leaving the surface undisturbed a dozen meters ahead the tunnel curved harsh yellow light threw hard shad ows on the seamed pseudo rock of the walls with a start case realized that the gravity here was near earth normal which meant that she had to descend again after the climb he was thoroughly lost now spatial disorientation held a peculiar hor ror for cowboys but she lost he told himself something scurried between her legs and went ticking across the un sand of the floor a red led blinked the braun the first of the holos waited just beyond the curve a sort of triptych she lowered the fletcher before case had had time to realize that the thing was a recording the figures were caricatures in light lifesize cartoons molly armitage and case molly s breasts were too large visible through tight black mesh beneath a heavy leather jacket her waist was impossibly narrow silvered lenses covered half her face she held an absurdly elaborate weapon of some kind a pistol shape nearly lost beneath a flanged overlay of scope sights silencers flash hiders her legs were spread pelvis canted forward her mouth fixed in a leer of idiotic cruelty beside her armitage stood rigidly at attention in a threadbare khaki uniform his eyes case saw as molly stepped carefully forward were tiny mon itor screens each one displaying the blue gray image of a howling waste of snow the stripped black trunks of evergreens bending in silent winds she passed the tips of her fingers through armitage tele vision eyes then turned to the figure of case here it was as if riviera and case had known instantly that riviera was responsible had been unable to find anything worthy of par ody the figure that slouched there was a fair approximation of the one he glimpsed daily in mirrors thin high shouldered a forgettable face beneath short dark hair he needed a shave but then he usually did molly stepped back she looked from one figure to another rt was a static display the only movement the silent gusting of the black trees in armitage frozen siberian eyes tryin to tell us something peter she asked softly then she stepped forward and kicked at something between the feet of the holo molly metal clinked against the wall and the figures were gone she bent and picked up a small display unit guess he can jack into these and program them direct she said tossing it away she passed the source of yellow light an archaic incandes cent globe set into the wall protected by a rusty curve of expansion grating the style of the improvised fixture sug gested childhood somehow he remembered fortresses he built with other children on rooftops and in flooded sub base ments a rich kid hideout he thought this kind of roughness was expensive what they called atmosphere she passed a dozen more holograms before she reached the entrance to jane apartments one depicted the eyeless thing in the alley behind the spice bazaar as it tore itself free of riviera shattered body several others were scenes of torture the inquisitors always military officers and the victims invari ably young women these had the awful intensity of riviera show at the vingtieme siecle as though they had been frozen in the blue flash of orgasm molly looked away as she passed them the last was small and dim as if it were an image riviera had had to drag across some private distance of memory and time she had to kneel to examine it it had been projected from the vantage point of a small child none of the others had had backgrounds the figures uniforms instruments of torture all had been freestanding displays but this was a view a dark wave of rubble rose against a colorless sky beyond its crest the bleached half melted skeletons of city towers the rubble wave was textured like a net rusting steel rods twisted gracefully as fine string vast slabs of concrete still clinging there the foreground might once have been a city square there was a sort of stump something that suggested a fountain at its base the children and the soldier were frozen the tableau was confusing at first molly must have read it correctly before case had quite assimilated it because he felt her tense she spat then stood children feral in rags teeth glittering like knives sores on their contorted faces the soldier on his back mouth and throat open to the sky they were feeding bonn she said something like gentleness in her voice quite the product you peter but you had to be our jane she too jaded now to open the back door for just any petty thief so wintermute dug you up the ultimate taste if your taste runs that way demon lover peter she shivered but you talked her into letting me in thanks now we re gonna party and then she was walking strolling really in spite of the pain away from riviera childhood she drew the fletcher from its holster snapped the plastic magazine out pocketed that and replaced it with another she hooked her thumb in the neck of the modern suit and ripped it open to the crotch with a single gesture her thumb blade parting the tough po lycarbon like rotten silk she freed herself from the arms and legs the shredded remnants disguising themselves as they fell to the dark false sand case noticed the music then a music he know all horns and piano the entrance to jane world had no door it was a ragged five meter gash in the tunnel wall uneven stairs leading down in a broad shallow curve faint blue light moving shadows music case she said and paused the fletcher in her right hand then she raised her left smiled touched her open palm with a wet tongue tip kissing him through the simstim link gotta go then there was something small and heavy in her left hand her thumb against a tiny stud and she was descending
CH04-P148,CH04,she missed it by a fraction she nearly cut it but not quite she went in just right case thought the right attitude it was something he could sense something he could have seen in the posture of another cowboy leaning into a deck fingers flying across the board she had it the thing the moves and she pulled it all together for her entrance pulled it together around the pain in her leg and marched down jane stairs like she owned the place elbow of her gun arm at her hip forearm up wrist relaxed swaying the muzzle of the fletcher with the studied nonchalance of a regency duelist it was a performance it was like the culmination of a life time observation of martial arts tapes cheap ones the kind case had grown up on for a few seconds he knew she was every bad ass hero sony mao in the old shaw videos mickey chiba the whole lineage back to lee and eastwood she was walking it the way she talked it lady jane marie france tessier ashpool had carved her self a low country flush with the inner surface of straylight hull chopping away the maze of walls that was her legacy she lived in a single room so broad and deep that its far reaches were lost to an inverse horizon the floor hidden by the cur vature of the spindle the ceiling was low and irregular done in the same imitation stone that walled the corridor here and there across the floor were jagged sections of wall waist high reminders of the labyrinth there was a rectangular turquoise pool centered ten meters from the foot of the stairway its underwater floods the apartment only source of light or it seemed that way to case as molly took her final step the pool threw shifting blobs of light across the ceiling above it they were waiting by the pool he known that her reflexes were souped up jazzed by the neurosurgeons for combat but he experienced them on the simstim link the effect was like tape run at half speed a slow deliberate dance choreographed to the killer instinct and years of training she seemed to take the three of them in at a glance the boy poised on the pool high board the girl grinning ove her wineglass and the corpse of ashpool his left socket gaping black and corrupt above his welcoming smile he wore his maroon robe his teeth were very white the boy dove slender brown his form perfect the gre nade left her hand before his hands could cut the water case knew the thing for what it was as it broke the surface a core of high explosive wrapped with ten meters of fine brittle steel wire her fletcher whined as she sent a storm of explosive darts into ashpool face and chest and he was gone smoke curling from the pocked back of the empty white enameled pool chair the muzzle swung for jane as the grenade detonated a symmetrical wedding cake of water rising breaking falling back but the mistake had been made hideo even touch her then her leg collapsed in garvey case screamed
CH04-P149,CH04,it took you long enough riviera said as he searched her pockets her hands vanished at the wrists in a matte black sphere the size of a bowling ball i saw a multiple assassination in ankara he said his fingers plucking things from her jacket a grenade job in a pool it seemed a very weak explosion but they all died instantly of hydrostatic shock case felt her move her fingers experimentally the material of the ball seemed to offer no more resistance than temperfoam the pain in her leg was excruciating impossible a red moire shifted in her vision i move them if i were you the interior of the ball seemed to tighten slightly it s a sex toy jane bought in berlin wiggle them long enough and it crushes them to a pulp variant of the material they make this flooring from something to do with the molecules i suppose are you in pain she groaned you seem to have injured your leg his fingers found the flat packet of drugs in the left back pocket of her jeans well my last taste from ali and just in time the shifting mesh of blood began to whirl hideo said another voice a woman she losing con sciousness give her something for that and for the pain she very striking you think peter these glasses are they a fashion where she comes from cool hands unhurried with a surgeon certainty the sting of a needle i know riviera was saying i ve never seen her native habitat they came and took me from turkey the sprawl yes we have interests there and once we sent hideo my fault really i let someone in a burglar he took the family terminal she laughed i made it easy for him to annoy the others he was a pretty boy my burglar is she waking hideo she have more more and she would die said a third voice the blood mesh slid into black the music returned horns and piano dance music

CH04-P153,CH04,she dreamed of a state involving very little in the way of individual consciousness jane was saying she cupped a large cameo in her hand extending it toward molly the carved profile was very much like her own animal bliss i think she viewed the evolution of the forebrain as a sort of sidestep she withdrew the brooch and studied it tilting it to catch the light at different angles only in certain heightened modes would an individual a clan member suffer the more pain ful aspects of self awareness molly nodded case remembered the injection what had they given her the pain was still there but it came through as a tight focus of scrambled impressions neon worms writhing in her thigh the touch of burlap smell of frying krill his mind recoiled from it if he avoided focusing on it the impres sions overlapped became a sensory equivalent of white noise if it could do that to her nervous system what would her frame of mind be her vision was abnormally clear and bright even sharper than usual things seemed to vibrate each person or object tuned to a minutely different frequency her hands still locked in the black ball were on her lap she sat in one of the pool chairs her broken leg propped straight in front of her on a camelskin hassock jane sat opposite on another hassock huddled in an oversized djellaba of unbleached wool she was very young where he go molly asked to take his shot jane shrugged beneath the folds of the pale heavy robe and tossed a strand of dark hair away from her eyes he told me when to let you in she said he tell me why everything has to be a mystery would you have hurt us case felt molly hesitate i would ve killed him i ve tried to kill the ninja then i was supposed to talk with you why jane asked tucking the cameo back into one of the djellaba inner pockets and why and what about molly seemed to be studying the high delicate bones the wide mouth the narrow hawk nose jane eyes were dark curiously opaque because i hate him she said at last and the why of that just the way i wired what he is and what i am and the show jane said i saw the show molly nodded but hideo because they re the best because one of them killed a partner of mine once jane became very grave she raised her eyebrows because i had to see molly said and then we would have talked you and i like this her dark hair was very straight center parted drawn back into a knot of dull sterling shall we talk now take this off molly said raising her captive hands you killed my father jane said no change whatever in her tone i was watching on the monitors my mother eyes he called them he killed the puppet it looked like you he was fond of broad gestures she said and then riviera was beside her radiant with drugs in the seersucker convict outfit he worn in the roof garden of their hotel getting acquainted she an interesting girl she i thought so when i first saw her he stepped past jane it going to work you know it peter molly managed a grin wintermute be the first to have made the same mis take underestimating me he crossed the tiled pool border to a white enamel table and splashed mineral water into a heavy crystal highball glass he talked with me molly i suppose he talked to all of us you and case whatever there is of armitage to talk to he really understand us you know he has his profiles but those are only statistics you may be the statistical animal darling and case is nothing but but i possess a quality unquantifiable by its very nature he drank and what exactly is that peter molly asked her voice flat riviera beamed perversity he walked back to the two women swirling the water that remained in the dense deeply carved cylinder of rock crystal as though he enjoyed the weight of the thing an enjoyment of the gratuitous act and i have made a decision molly a wholly gratuitous decision she waited looking up at him oh peter jane said with the sort of gentle exasperation ordinarily reserved for children no word for you molly he told me about that you see jane knows the code of course but you have it neither will wintermute my jane an ambitious girl in her perverse way he smiled again she has designs on the family empire and a pair of insane artificial intelligences kinky as the concept may be would only get in our way so comes her riviera to help her out you see and peter says sit tight play daddy favorite swing records and let peter call you up a band to match a floor of dancers a wake for dead king ashpool he drank off the last of the mineral water no you do daddy you would not do now that peter come home and then his face pink with the pleasure of cocaine and meperidine he swung the glass hard into her left lens implant smashing vision into blood and light

CH04-P157,CH04,maelcum was hunched over garvey controls tapping out commands for a docking sequence the module central screen displayed a fixed red square that represented the straylight dock garvey was a larger square green that shrank slowly wavering from side to side with maelcum commands to the left a smaller screen displayed a skeletal graphic of garvey and haniwa as they approached the curvature of the spindle we got an hour man case said pulling the ribbon of fiberoptics from the hosaka his deck back up batteries were good for ninety minutes but the flatline construct would be an additional drain he worked quickly mechanically fasten ing the construct to the bottom of the ono sendai with micro pore tape maelcum workbelt drifted past he snagged it unclipped the two lengths of shock cord with their gray rec tangular suction pads and hooked the jaws of one clip through the other he held the pads against the sides of his deck and worked the thumb lever that created suction with the deck construct and improvised shoulder strap suspended in front of him he struggled into his leather jacket checking the contents of his pockets the passport armitage had given him the bank chip in the same name the credit chip he been issued when he entered freeside two derms of the betaphenethylamine he bought from bruce a roll of new yen half a pack of yeheyuans and the shuriken he tossed the freeside chip over his shoulders heard it click off the russian scrubber he was about to do the same with the steel star but the rebounding credit chip clipped the back of his skull spun off struck the ceiling and tumbled past maelcum left shoulder the zionite interrupted his piloting to glare back at him case looked at the shuriken then tucked it into his jacket pocket hearing the lining tear you missin th mute mon maelcum said mute say he messin th security for garvey garvey dockin as nother boat boat they pectin out of babylon mute broadcastin codes for us we gonna wear the suits too heavy maelcum shrugged stay in web til i tell you he tapped a final sequence into the module and grabbed the worn pink handholds on either side of the navigation board case saw the green square shrink a final few millimeters to overlap the red square on the smaller screen haniwa lowered her bow to miss the curve of the spindle and was snared garvey was still slung beneath her like a captive grub the tug rang shuddered two stylized arms sprang out to grip the slender wasp shape straylight extruded a tentative yellow rectangle that curved groping past haniwa for garvey there was a scraping sound from the bow beyond the trem bling fronds of caulk mon maelcum said mind we got gravity a dozen small objects struck the floor of the cabin simultaneously as though drawn there by a magnet case gasped as his internal organs were pulled into a different configuration the deck and construct had fallen painfully to his lap they were attached to the spindle now rotating with it maelcum spread his arms flexed tension from his shoulders and removed his purple dreadbag shaking out his locks come now mon if you seh time be mos precious
CH04-P158,CH04,the villa straylight was a parasitic structure case reminded himself as he stepped past the tendrils of caulk and through marcus garvey forward hatch straylight bled air and water out of freeside and had no ecosystem of its own the gangway tube the dock had extended was a more elab orate version of the one he tumbled through to reach haniwa designed for use in the spindle rotation gravity a corrugated tunnel articulated by integral hydraulic members each seg ment ringed with a loop of tough nonslip plastic the loops serving as the rungs of a ladder the gangway had snaked its way around haniwa it was horizontal where it joined garvey s lock but curved up sharply and to the left a vertical climb around the curvature of the yacht hull maelcum was already making his way up the rings pulling himself up with his left hand the remington in his right he wore a stained pair of baggy fatigues his sleeveless green nylon jacket and a pair of ragged canvas sneakers with bright red soles the gangway shifted slightly each time he climbed to another ring the clips on case makeshift strap dug into his shoulder with the weight of the ono sendai and the flatline construct all he felt now was fear a generalized dread he pushed it away forcing himself to replay armitage lecture on the spin dle and villa straylight he started climbing freeside eco system was limited not closed zion was a closed system capable of cycling for years without the introduction of external materials freeside produced its own air and water but relied on constant shipments of food on the regular augmentation of soil nutrients the villa straylight produced nothing at all mon maelcum said quietly get up here ide me case edged sideways on the circular ladder and climbed the last few rungs the gangway ended in a smooth slightly convex hatch two meters in diameter the hydraulic members of the tube vanished into flexible housings set into the frame of the hatch so what do we case mouth shut as the hatch swung up a slight differential in pressure puffing fine grit into his eyes maelcum scrambled up over the edge and case heard the tiny click of the remington safety being released you th mon in th hurry maelcum whispered crouching there then case was beside him the hatch was centered in a round vaulted chamber floored with blue nonslip plastic tiles maelcum nudged him pointed and he saw a monitor set into a curved wall on the screen a tall young man with the tessier ashpool features was brushing something from the sleeves of his dark suitcoat he stood beside an identical hatch in an identical chamber very sorry sir said a voice from a grid centered above the hatch case glanced up expected you later at the axial dock one moment please on the monitor the young man tossed his head impatiently maelcum spun as a door slid open to their left the shotgun ready a small eurasian in orange coveralls stepped through and goggled at them he opened his mouth but nothing came out he closed his mouth case glanced at the monitor blank who the man managed the rastafarian navy case said standing up the cyber space deck banging against his hip and all we want a jack into your custodial system the man swallowed is this a test it a loyalty check it must be a loyalty check he wiped the palms of his hands on the thighs of his orange suit no mon this a real one maelcum came up out of his crouch with the remington pointed at the eurasian face you move it they followed the man back through the door into a corridor whose polished concrete walls and irregular floor of overlap ping carpets were perfectly familiar to case pretty rugs maelcum said prodding the man in the back smell like church they came to another monitor an antique sony this one mounted above a console with a keyboard and a complex array of jack panels the screen lit as they halted the finn grinning tensely out at them from what seemed to be the front room of metro holografix okay he said maelcum takes this guy down the corridor to the open locker door sticks him in there i ll lock it case you want the fifth socket from the left top panel there adaptor plugs in the cabinet under the console needs ono sendai twenty point into hitachi forty as mael cum nudged his captive along case knelt and fumbled through an assortment of plugs finally coming up with the one he needed with his deck jacked into the adaptor he paused do you have to look like that man he asked the face on the screen the finn was erased a line at a time by the image of lonny zone against a wall of peeling japanese posters anything you want baby zone drawled just hop it for lonny no case said use the finn as the zone image van ished he shoved the hitachi adaptor into its socket and settled the trodes across his forehead
CH04-P159,CH04,what kept you the flatline asked and laughed told you do that case said joke boy the construct said zero time lapse for me lemme see what we got here the kuang program was green exactly the shade of the t a ice even as case watched it grew gradually more opaque although he could see the black mirrored shark thing clearly when he looked up the fracture lines and hallucinations were gone now and the thing looked real as marcus garvey a wingless antique jet its smooth skin plated with black chrome right on the flatline said right case said and flipped
CH04-P160,CH04,like that i sorry jane was saying as she bandaged molly head our unit says no concussion no permanent damage to the eye you know him very well before you came here know him at all molly said bleakly she was on her back on a high bed or padded table case feel the injured leg the synaesthetic effect of the original injection seemed to have worn off the black ball was gone but her hands were immobilized by soft straps she see he wants to kill you figures molly said staring up at the rough ceiling past a very bright light i think i want him to jane said and molly pain fully turned her head to look up into the dark eyes play with me she said but i think i might like to jane said and bent to kiss her forehead brushing the hair back with a warm hand there were smears of blood on her pale djellaba where he gone now molly asked another injection probably jane said straightening up he was quite impatient for your arrival i think it might be fun to nurse you back to health molly she smiled absently wiping a bloody hand down the front of the robe your leg will need to be reset but we can arrange that what about peter peter she gave her head a little shake a strand of dark hair came loose fell across her forehead peter has become rather boring i find drug use in general to be boring she giggled in others at any rate my father was a dedicated abuser as you must have seen molly tensed alarm yourself jane fingers brushed the skin above the waistband of the leather jeans his suicide was the result of my having manipulated the safety margins of his freeze i never actually met him you know i was decanted after he last went down to sleep but i did know him very well the cores know everything i watched him kill my mother i ll show you that when you re better he strangles her in bed why did he kill her her unbandaged eye focused on the girl face he accept the direction she intended for our fam ily she commissioned the construction of our artificial intel ligences she was quite a visionary she imagined us in a symbiotic relationship with the al our corporate decisions made for us our conscious decisions i should say tessier ashpool would be immortal a hive each of us units of a larger entity fascinating i ll play her tapes for you nearly a thousand hours but i ve never understood her really and with her death her direction was lost all direction was lost and we began to burrow into ourselves now we seldom come out i the exception there you said you were trying to kill the old man you fiddled his cryogenic programs jane nodded i had help from a ghost that was what i thought when i was very young that there were ghosts in the corporate cores voices one of them was what you call win termute which is the turing code for our berne al although the entity manipulating you is a sort of subprogram one of them there more one other but that one spoken to me in years it gave up i think i suspect that both represent the fruition of certain capacities my mother ordered designed into the original software but she was an extremely secretive woman when she felt it necessary here drink she put a flexible plastic tube to molly lips water only a little jane love riviera asked cheerfully from somewhere out of sight are you enjoying yourself leave us alone peter playing doctor suddenly molly stared into her own face the image suspended ten centimeters from her nose there were no bandages the left implant was shattered a long finger of silvered plastic driven deep in a socket that was an inverted pool of blood hideo jane said stroking molly stomach hurt peter if he go away go and swim peter the projection vanished in the darkness of the bandaged eye he said you know the code peter said wintermute needs the code case was suddenly aware of the chubb key that lay on its nylon thong against the inner curve of her left breast yes jane said withdrawing her hand i do i learned it as a child i think i learned it in a dream or somewhere in the thousand hours of my mother diaries but i think that peter has a point in urging me not to surrender it there would be turing to contend with if i read all this correctly and ghosts are nothing if not capricious case jacked out
CH04-P161,CH04,strange little customer huh the finn grinned at case from the old sony case shrugged he saw maelcum coming back along the corridor with the remington at his side the zionite was smil ing his head bobbing to a rhythm case hear a pair of thin yellow leads ran from his ears to a side pocket in his sleeveless jacket dub mon maelcum said you re fucking crazy case told him hear okay mon righteous dub hey guys the finn said on your toes here comes your transportation i finesse many numbers as smooth as the pic of jean that conned your doorman but i can get you a ride over to jane place case was pulling the adaptor from its socket when the rid erless service cart swiveled into sight under the graceless con crete arch marking the far end of their corridor it might have been the one his africans had ridden but if it was they were gone now just behind the back of the low padded seat its tiny manipulators gripping the upholstery the little braun was steadily winking its red led bus to catch case said to maelcum
CH04-P162,CH04,he lost his anger again he missed it the little cart was crowded maelcum the remington across his knees and case deck and construct against his chest the cart was operating at speeds it been designed for it was top heavy cornering and maelcum had taken to leaning out in the direction of the turns this presented no problem when the thing took lefts because case sat on the right but in the right turns the zionite had to lean across case and his gear crushing him against the seat he had no idea where they were everything was familiar but he be sure he seen any particular stretch before a curving hallway lined with wooden showcases displayed collections he was certain he never seen the skulls of large birds coins masks of beaten silver the service cart six tires were silent on the layered carpets there was only the whine of the electric motor and an occasional faint burst of zion dub from the foam beads in maelcum ears as he lunged past case to counter a sharp right the deck and the construct kept press ing the shuriken in his jacket pocket into his hip you got a watch he asked maelcum the zionite shook his locks time be time jesus case said and closed his eyes
CH04-P163,CH04,the braun scuttled over mounded carpets and tapped one of its padded claws against an oversized rectangular door of dark battered wood behind them the cart sizzled and shot blue sparks from a louvered panel the sparks struck the carpet beneath the cart and case smelled scorched wool this th way mon maelcum eyed the door and snapped the shotgun safety hey case said more to himself than to maelcum you think i know the braun rotated its spherical body and the led strobed it wan you open door maelcum said nodding case stepped forward and tried the ornate brass knob there was a brass plate mounted on the door at eye level so old that the lettering that had once been engraved there had been re duced to a spidery unreadable code the name of some long dead function or functionary polished into oblivion he won dered vaguely if tessier ashpool had selected each piece of straylight individually or if they purchased it in bulk from some vast european equivalent of metro holografix the door hinges creaked plaintively as he edged it open maelcum step ping past him with the remington thrust forward from his hip books maelcum said the library the white steel shelves with their labels i know where we are case said he looked back at the service cart a curl of smoke was rising from the carpet so come on he said cart cart it remained stationary the braun was plucking at the leg of his jeans nipping at his ankle he resisted a strong urge to kick it yeah it ticked its way around the door he followed it the monitor in the library was another sony as old as the first one the braun paused beneath it and executed a sort of jig wintermute the familiar features filled the screen the finn smiled time to check in case the finn said his eyes screwed up against the smoke of a cigarette c on jack the braun threw itself against his ankle and began to climb his leg its manipulators pinching his flesh through the thin black cloth shit he slapped it aside and it struck the wall two of its limbs began to piston repeatedly uselessly pumping the air what wrong with the goddam thing burned out the finn said forget it no problem lack in now there were four sockets beneath the screen but only one would accept the hitachi adaptor he jacked in
CH04-P164,CH04,nothing gray void no matrix no grid no cyberspace the deck was gone his fingers were and on the far rim of consciousness a scurrying a fleeting impression of something rushing toward him across leagues of black mirror he tried to scream
CH04-P165,CH04,there seemed to be a city beyond the curve of beach but it was far away he crouched on his haunches on the damp sand his arms wrapped tight across his knees and shook he stayed that way for what seemed a very long time even after the shaking stopped the city if it was a city was low and gray at times it was obscured by banks of mist that came rolling in over the lapping surf at one point he decided that it a city at all but some single building perhaps a ruin he had no way of judging its distance the sand was the shade of tarnished silver that gone entirely black the beach was made of sand the beach was very long the sand was damp the bottoms of his jeans were wet from the sand he held himself and rocked singing a song without words or tune the sky was a different silver chiba like the chiba sky tokyo bay he turned his head and stared out to sea longing for the hologram logo of fuji electric for the drone of a helicopter anything at all behind him a gull cried he shivered a wind was rising sand stung his cheek he put his face against his knees and wept the sound of his sobbing as distant and alien as the cry of the searching gull hot urine soaked his jeans dribbled on the sand and quickly cooled in the wind off the water when his tears were gone his throat ached wintermute he mumbled to his knees wintermute it was growing dark now and when he shivered it was with a cold that finally forced him to stand his knees and elbows ached his nose was running he wiped it on the cuff of his jacket then searched one empty pocket after another jesus he said shoulders hunched tucking his fingers beneath his arms for warmth jesus his teeth began to chatter the tide had left the beach combed with patterns more subtle than any a tokyo gardener produced when he taken a dozen steps in the direction of the now invisible city he turned and looked back through the gathering dark his footprints stretched to the point of his arrival there were no other marks to disturb the tarnished sand he estimated that he covered at least a kilometer before he noticed the light he was talking with ratz and it was ratz who first pointed it out an orange red glow to his right away from the surf he knew that ratz there that the bartender was a figment of his own imagination not of the thing he was trapped in but that matter he called the man up for comfort of some kind but ratz had had his own ideas about case and his predicament really my artiste you amaze me the lengths you will go to in order to accomplish your own destruction the re dundancy of it in night city you had it in the palm of your hand the speed to eat your sense away drink to keep it all so fluid linda for a sweeter sorrow and the street to hold the axe how far you ve come to do it now and what grotesque props playgrounds hung in space castles hermetically sealed the rarest rots of old europa dead men sealed in little boxes magic out of china ratz laughed trudging along beside him his pink manipulator swinging jauntily at his side in spite of the dark case could see the baroque steel that laced the bartender blackened teeth but i suppose that is the way of an artiste no you needed this world built for you this beach this place to die case halted swayed turned toward the sound of surf and the sting of blown sand yeah he said shit i guess he walked toward the sound artiste he heard ratz call the light you saw a light here this way he stopped again staggered fell to his knees in a few millimeters of icy seawater ratz light ratz but the dark was total now and there was only the sound of the surf he struggled to his feet and tried to retrace his steps time passed he walked on and then it was there a glow defining itself with his every step a rectangle a door fire in there he said his words torn away by the wind it was a bunker stone or concrete buried in drifts of the dark sand the doorway was low narrow doorless and deep set into a wall at least a meter thick hey case said softly hey his fingers brushed the cold wall there was a fire in there shifting shadows on the sides of the entrance he ducked low and was through inside in three steps a girl was crouched beside rusted steel a sort of fireplace where driftwood burned the wind sucking smoke up a dented chimney the fire was the only light and as his gaze met the wide startled eyes he recognized her headband a rolled scarf printed with a pattern like magnified circuitry
CH04-P166,CH04,he refused her arms that night refused the food she offered him the place beside her in the nest of blankets and shredded foam he crouched beside the door finally and watched her sleep listening to the wind scour the structure walls every hour or so he rose and crossed to the makeshift stove adding fresh driftwood from the pile beside it none of this was real but cold was cold she real curled there on her side in the firelight he watched her mouth the lips parted slightly she was the girl he remembered from their trip across the bay and that was cruel mean motherfucker he whispered to the wind take a chance do you give me any junkie huh i know what this is he tried to keep the desperation from his voice i know see i know who you are you re the other one jane told molly burning bush that wintermute it was you he tried to warn me off with the braun now you got me flatlined you got me here nowhere with a ghost like i remember her before she stirred in her sleep called something out drawing a scrap of blanket across her shoulder and cheek you anything he said to the sleeping girl you re dead and you meant fuck all to me anyway hear that buddy i know what you re doing i flatlined this has all taken about twenty seconds right i out on my ass in that library and my brain dead and pretty soon it ll be dead if you got any sense you want wintermute to pull his scam off is all so you can just hang me up here dixie ll run kuang but his ass is dead and you can second guess his moves sure this linda shit yeah that all been you it wintermute tried to use her when he sucked me into the chiba construct but he said it was too tricky that was you moved the stars around in freeside it that was you put her face on the dead puppet in ashpool room molly never saw that you just edited her simstim signal cause you think you can hurt me cause you think i gave a shit well fuck you whatever you re called you won you win but none of it means anything to me now right think i care so why you do it to me this way he was shaking again his voice shrill honey she said twisting up from the rags of blankets you come here and sleep i ll sit up you want you gotta sleep okay her soft accent was exaggerated with sleep you just sleep okay
CH04-P167,CH04,when he woke she was gone the fire was dead but it was warm in the bunker sunlight slanting through the doorway to throw a crooked rectangle of gold on the ripped side of a fat fiber canister the thing was a shipping container he remembered them from the chiba docks through the rent in its side he could see half a dozen bright yellow packets in the sunlight they looked like giant pats of butter his stomach tightened with hunger rolling out of the nest he went to the canister and fished one of the things out blinking at small print in a dozen languages the english was on the bottom emerg ration hi pro beef type ag a listing of nutri
CH04-P168,CH04,tive content he fumbled a second one out eggs if you re making this shit up he said you could lay on some real food okay with a packet in either hand he made his way through the structure four rooms two were empty aside from drifts of sand and the fourth held three more of the ration canisters sure he said touching the seals stay here a long time i get the idea sure he searched the room with the fireplace finding a plastic canister filled with what he assumed was rainwater beside the nest of blankets against the wall lay a cheap red lighter a seaman knife with a cracked green handle and her scarf it was still knotted and stiff with sweat and dirt he used the knife to open the yellow packets dumping their contents into a rusted can that he found beside the stove he dipped water from the canister mixed the resulting mush with his fingers and ate it tasted vaguely like beef when it was gone he tossed the can into the fireplace and went out late afternoon by the feel of the sun its angle he kicked off his damp nylon shoes and was startled by the warmth of the sand in daylight the beach was silver gray the sky was cloudless blue he rounded the comer of the bunker and walked toward the surf dropping his jacket on the sand dunno whose memories you re using for this one he said when he reached the water he peeled off his jeans and kicked them into the shallow surf following them with t shirt and underwear what you doin case he turned and found her ten meters down the beach the white foam sliding past her ankles i pissed myself last night he said well you wanna wear those saltwater give you sores i ll show you this pool back in the rocks she gestured vaguely behind her it fresh the faded french fatigues had been hacked away above the knee the skin below was smooth and brown a breeze caught at her hair listen he said scooping his clothes up and walking to ward her i got a question for you i ask you what you re doing here but what exactly do you think i doing here he stopped a wet black jeans leg slapping against his bare thigh you came last night she said she smiled at him and that enough for you i just came he said you would she said wrinkling her nose she shrugged he knows stuff like that i guess she lifted her left foot and rubbed salt from the other ankle awkward child like she smiled at him again more tentatively now you answer me one okay he nodded how come you re painted brown like that all except your foot
CH04-P169,CH04,and that the last thing you remember he watched her scrape the last of the freeze dried hash from the rectangular steel box cover that was their only plate she nodded her eyes huge in the firelight i sorry case honest to god it was just the shit i guess an it was she hunched forward forearms across her knees her face twisted for a few seconds with pain or its memory i just needed the money to get home i guess or hell she said you hardly talk to me there no cigarettes goddam case you asked me that ten times today what wrong with you she twisted a strand of hair into her mouth and chewed at it but the food was here it was already here i told you man it was washed up on the damn beach okay sure it seamless she started to cry again a dry sobbing well damn you anyway case she managed finally i was doin just fine here by myself he got up taking his jacket and ducked through the door way scraping his wrist on rough concrete there was no moon no wind sea sound all around him in the darkness his jeans were tight and clammy okay he said to the night i buy it i guess i buy it but tomorrow some cigarettes better wash up his own laughter startled him a case of beer hurt while you re at it he turned and re entered the bunker she was stirring the embers with a length of silvered wood who was that case up in your coffin in cheap hotel flash samurai with those silver shades black leather scared me and after i figured maybe she was your new girl cept she looked like more money than you had she glanced back at him i real sorry i stole your ram never mind he said mean anything so you just took it over to this guy and had him access it for you tony she said i been seein him kinda he had a habit an we anyway yeah i remember him running it by on this monitor and it was this real amazing graphics stuff and i remember wonderin how you there any graphics in there he interrupted sure was i just figure how you have all those pictures of when i was little case how my daddy looked before he left gimme this duck one time painted wood and you had a picture of that tony see it i remember next thing i was on the beach real early sunrise those birds all yellin so lonely scared cause i have a shot on me nothin an i knew i be gettin sick an i walked an walked til it was dark an found this place an next day the food washed in all tangled in the green sea stuff like leaves of hard jelly she slid her stick into the embers and left it there never did get sick she said as embers crawled missed cigarettes more how bout you case you still wired firelight dancing under her cheek bones remembered flash of wizard castle and tank war europa no he said and then it no longer mattered what he knew tasting the salt of her mouth where tears had dried there was a strength that ran in her something he known in night city and held there been held by it held for a while away from time and death from the relentless street that hunted them all it was a place he known before not everyone could take him there and somehow he always managed to forget it something he found and lost so many times it belonged he knew he remembered as she pulled him down to the meat the flesh the cowboys mocked it was a vast thing beyond know ing a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone infinite intricacy that only the body in its strong blind way could ever read the zipper hung caught as he opened the french fatigues the coils of toothed nylon clotted with salt he broke it some tiny metal part shooting off against the wall as salt rotten cloth gave and then he was in her effecting the transmission of the old message here even here in a place he knew for what it was a coded model of some stranger memory the drive held she shuddered against him as the stick caught fire a leaping flare that threw their locked shadows across the bunker wall later as they lay together his hand between her thighs he remembered her on the beach the white foam pulling at her ankles and he remembered what she had said he told you i was coming he said but she only rolled against him buttocks against his thighs and put her hand over his and muttered something out of dream
CH04-P170,CH04,the music woke him and at first it might have been the beat of his own heart he sat up beside her pulling his jacket over his shoulders in the predawn chill gray light from the doorway and the fire long dead his vision crawled with ghost hieroglyphs translucent lines of symbols arranging themselves against the neutral backdrop of the bunker wall he looked at the backs of his hands saw faint neon molecules crawling beneath the skin ordered by the unknowable code he raised his right hand and moved it ex perimentally it left a faint fading trail of strobed afterimages the hair stood up along his arms and at the back of his neck he crouched there with his teeth bared and felt for the music the pulse faded returned faded what wrong she sat up clawing hair from her eyes baby i feel like a drug you get that here she shook her head reached for him her hands on his upper arms linda who told you who told you i come who on the beach she said something forcing her to look away a boy i see him on the beach maybe thirteen he lives here and what did he say he said you come he said you hate me he said we be okay here and he told me where the rain pool was he looks mexican brazilian case said as a new wave of symbols washed down the wall i think he from rio he got to his feet and began to struggle into his jeans case she said her voice shaking case where you goin i think i ll find that boy he said as the music came surging back still only a beat steady and familiar although he place it in memory case i thought i saw something when i got here a city down the beach but yesterday it there you ever seen that he yanked his zipper up and tore at the impossible knot in his shoelaces finally tossing the shoes into the corner she nodded eyes lowered yeah i see it sometimes you ever go there linda he put his jacket on no she said but i tried after i first came an i was bored anyway i figured it a city maybe i could find some shit she grimaced i even sick i just wanted it so i took food in a can mixed it real wet because i have another can for water an i walked all day an i could see it sometimes city an it seem too far but it never got any closer an then it was gettin closer an i saw what it was sometimes that day it had looked kinda like it was wrecked or maybe nobody there an other times i thought i see light flashin off a machine cars or somethin her voice trailed off what is it this thing she gestured around at the fireplace the dark walls the dawn outlining the doorway where we live it gets smaller case smaller closer you get to it pausing one last time by the doorway you ask your boy about that yeah he said i understand an i was wastin my time said it was was like an event an it was our horizon event horizon he called it the words meant nothing to him he left the bunker and struck out blindly heading he knew somehow away from the sea now the hieroglyphs sped across the sand fled from his feet drew back from him as he walked hey he said it breaking down bet you know too what is it kuang chinese icebreaker eating a hole in your heart maybe the dixie flatline no pushover huh he heard her call his name looked back and she was following him not trying to catch up the broken zip of the french fatigues flapping against the brown of her belly pubic hair framed in torn fabric she looked like one of the girls on the finn old magazines in metro holografix come to life only she was tired and sad and human the ripped costume pathetic as she stumbled over clumps of salt silver sea grass and then somehow they stood in the surf the three of them and the boy gums were wide and bright pink against his thin brown face he wore ragged colorless shorts limbs too thin against the sliding blue gray of the tide i know you case said linda beside him no the boy said his voice high and musical you do not you re the other ai you re rio you re the one who wants to stop wintermute what your name your turing code what is it the boy did a handstand in the surf laughing he walked on his hands then flipped out of the water his eyes were riviera but there was no malice there to call up a demon you must learn its name men dreamed that once but now it is real in another way you know that case your business is to learn the names of programs the long formal names names the owners seek to conceal true names a turing code not your name neuromancer the boy said slitting long gray eyes against the rising sun the lane to the land of the dead where you are my friend marie france my lady she prepared this road but her lord choked her off before i could read the book of he days neuro from the nerves the silver paths romancer nec romancer i call up the dead but no my friend and the boy did a little dance brown feet printing the sand i am the dead and their land he laughed a gull cried stay if your woman is a ghost she know it neither will you you re cracking the ice is breaking up no he said suddenly sad his fragile shoulders sagging he rubbed his foot against the sand it is more simple than that but the choice is yours the gray eyes regarded case gravely a fresh wave of symbols swept across his vision one line at a time behind them the boy wriggled as though seen through heat rising from summer asphalt the music was loud now and case could almost make out the lyrics case honey linda said and touched his shoulder no he said he took off his jacket and handed it to her i know he said maybe you re here anyway it gets cold he turned and walked away and after the seventh step he closed his eyes watching the music define itself at the center of things he did look back once although he open his eyes he need to they were there by the edge of the sea linda lee and the thin child who said his name was neuromancer his leather jacket dangled from her hand catching the fringe of the surf he walked on following the music maelcum zion dub
CH04-P171,CH04,there was a gray place an impression of fine screens shift ing moire degrees of half tone generated by a very simple graphics program there was a long hold on a view through chainlink gulls frozen above dark water there were voices there was a plain of black mirror that tilted and he was quicksilver a bead of mercury skittering down striking the angles of an invisible maze fragmenting flowing together sliding again
CH04-P172,CH04,case mon the music you back mon the music was taken from his ears how long he heard himself ask and knew that his mouth was very dry five minute maybe too long i wan pull th jack mute seh no screen goin funny then mute seh put th phones on you he opened his eyes maelcum features were overlayed with bands of translucent hieroglyphs an you medicine maelcum said two derm he was flat on his back on the library floor below the monitor the zionite helped him sit up but the movement threw him into the savage rush of the betaphenethylamine the blue derms burning against his left wrist overdose he man aged come on mon the strong hands beneath his armpits lifting him like a child i an i mus go
CH04-P173,CH04,the service cart was crying the betaphenethylamine gave it a voice it stop not in the crowded gallery the long corridors not as it passed the black glass entrance to the t a crypt the vaults where the cold had seeped so gradually into old ashpool dreams the transit was an extended rush for case the movement of the cart indistinguishable from the insane momentum of the overdose when the cart died at last something beneath the seat giving up with a shower of white sparks the crying stopped the thing coasted to a stop three meters from the start of jane pirate cave how far mon maelcum helped him from the sputtering cart as an integral extinguisher exploded in the thing engine compartment gouts of yellow powder squirting from louvers and service points the braun tumbled from the back of the seat and hobbled off across the imitation sand dragging one useless limb behind it you mus walk mon maelcum took the deck and construct slinging the shock cords over his shoul der
CH04-P174,CH04,the trodes rattled around case neck as he followed the zionite riviera holos waited for them the torture scenes and the cannibal children molly had broken the triptych maelcum ignored them easy case said forcing himself to catch up with the striding figure gotta do this right maelcum halted turned glowering at him the remington in his hands right mon how right got molly in there but she out of it riviera he can throw holos maybe he got molly fletcher maelcum nod ded and there a ninja a family bodyguard maelcum frown deepened you listen babylon mon he said i a warrior but this no m fight no zion fight babylon fightin babylon eatin i elf ya know but jah seh i an i t bring steppin razor outa this case blinked she a warrior maelcum said as if it explained everything now you tell me mon who i not t kill jane he said after a pause a girl there has a kinda white robe thing on with a hood we need her
CH04-P175,CH04,when they reached the entrance maelcum walked straight in and case had no choice but to follow him jane country was deserted the pool empty maelcum handed him the deck and the construct and walked to the edge of the pool beyond the white pool furniture there was dark ness shadows of the ragged waist high maze of partially demolished walls the water lapped patiently against the side of the pool they re here case said they gotta be maelcum nodded the first arrow pierced his upper arm the remington roared its meter of muzzle flash blue in the light from the pool the second arrow struck the shotgun itself sending it spinning across the white tiles maelcum sat down hard and fumbled at the black thing that protruded from his arm he yanked at it hideo stepped out of the shadows a third arrow ready in a slender bamboo bow he bowed maelcum stared his hand still on the steel shaft the artery is intact the ninja said case remembered molly description of the man who d killed her lover hideo was another ageless he radiated a sense of quiet an utter calm he wore clean frayed khaki workpants and soft dark shoes that fit his feet like gloves split at the toes like tabi socks the bamboo bow was a museum piece but the black alloy quiver that protruded above his left shoulder had the look of the best chiba weapons shops his brown chest was bare and smooth you cut my thumb mon wi secon one maelcum said coriolis force the ninja said bowing again most dif ficult slow moving projectile in rotational gravity it was not intended where jane case crossed to stand beside maelcum he saw that the tip of the arrow in the ninja bow was like a double edged razor where molly hello case riviera came strolling out of the dark behind hideo molly fletcher in his hand i would have expected armitage somehow are we hiring help out of that rasta cluster now armitage is dead armitage never existed more to the point but the news hardly comes as a shock wintermute killed him he in orbit around the spindle riviera nodded his long gray eyes glancing from case to maelcum and back i think it ends here for you he said where molly the ninja relaxed his pull on the fine braided string low ering the bow he crossed the tiles to where the remington lay and picked it up this is without subtlety he said as if to himself his voice was cool and pleasant his every move was part of a dance a dance that never ended even when his body was still at rest but for all the power it suggested there was also a humility an open simplicity it ends here for her too riviera said maybe jane go for that peter case said uncertain of the impulse the derms still raged in his system the old fever starting to grip him night city craziness he remembered moments of grace dealing out on the edge of things where he found that he could sometimes talk faster than he could think
CH04-P176,CH04,the gray eyes narrowed why case why do you think that case smiled riviera know about the simstim rig he missed it in his hurry to find the drugs she carried for him but how could hideo have missed it and case was certain the ninja would never have let jane treat molly without first checking her for kinks and concealed weapons no he decided the ninja knew so jane would know as well tell me case riviera said raising the pepperbox muzzle of the fletcher something creaked behind him creaked again jane pushed molly out of the shadows in an ornate victorian bathchair its tall spidery wheels squeaking as they turned molly was bun dled deep in a red and black striped blanket the narrow caned back of the antique chair towering above her she looked very small broken a patch of brilliantly white micropore covered her damaged lens the other flashed emptily as her head bobbed with the motion of the chair a familiar face jane said i saw you the night of peter show and who is this maelcum case said hideo remove the arrow and bandage mr malcolm wound case was staring at molly at the wan face the ninja walked to where maelcum sat pausing to lay his bow and the shotgun well out of reach and took something from his pocket a pair of bolt cutters i must cut the shaft he said it is too near the artery maelcum nodded his face was grayish and sheened with sweat case looked at jane there much time he said for whom exactly for any of us there was a snap as hideo cut through the metal shaft of the arrow maelcum groaned really riviera said it amuse you to hear this failed con artist make a last desperate pitch most distasteful can assure you he ll wind up on his knees offer to sell you his mother perform the most boring sexual favors jane threw back her head and laughed pe ter the ghosts are gonna mix it tonight lady case said wintermute going up against the other one neuromancer for keeps you know that jane raised her eyebrows peter suggested something like that but tell me more i met neuromancer he talked about your mother i think he something like a giant rom construct for recording per sonality only it full ram the constructs think they re there like it real but it just goes on forever jane stepped from behind the bathchair where describe the place this construct a beach gray sand like silver that needs polishing and a concrete thing kinda bunker he hesitated it nothing fancy just old falling apart if you walk far enough you come back to where you started yes she said morocco when marie france was a girl years before she married ashpool she spent a summer alone on that beach camping in an abandoned blockhouse she for mulated the basis of her philosophy there hideo straightened slipping the cutters into his workpants he held a section of the arrow in either hand maelcum had his eyes closed his hand clapped tight around his bicep i will bandage it hideo said case managed to fall before riviera could level the fletcher for a clear shot the darts whined past his neck like supersonic gnats he rolled seeing hideo pivot through yet another step of his dance the razored point of the arrow reversed in his hand shaft flat along palm and rigid fingers he flicked it underhand wrist blurring into the back of riviera hand the fletcher struck the tiles a meter away riviera screamed but not in pain it was a shriek of rage so pure so refined that it lacked all humanity twin tight beams of light ruby red needles stabbed from the region of riviera sternum the ninja grunted reeled back hands to his eyes then found his balance peter jane said peter what have you done he blinded your clone boy molly said flatly hideo lowered his cupped hands frozen on the white tile case saw whisps of steam drift from the ruined eyes riviera smiled
CH04-P177,CH04,hideo swung into his dance retracing his steps when he stood above the bow the arrow and the remington riviera smile had faded he bent bowing it seemed to case and found the bow and arrow you re blind riviera said taking a step backward peter jane said you know he does it in the dark zen it the way he practices the ninja notched his arrow will you distract me with your holograms now riviera was backing away into the dark beyond the pool he brushed against a white chair its feet rattled on the tile hideo arrow twitched riviera broke and ran throwing himself over a low jagged length of wall the ninja face was rapt suffused with a quiet ecstasy smiling he padded off into the shadows beyond the wall his weapon held ready jane lady maelcum whispered and case turned to see him scoop the shotgun from the tiles blood spattering the white ceramic he shook his locks and lay the fat barrel in the crook of his wounded arm this take your head off no babylon doctor fix it jane stared at the remington molly freed her arms from the folds of the striped blanket raising the black sphere that encased her hands off she said get it off case rose from the tiles shook himself hideo ll get him even blind he asked jane when i was a child she said we loved to blindfold him he put arrows through the pips in playing cards at ten meters peter good as dead anyway molly said in another twelve hours he ll start to freeze up be able to move his eyes is all why case turned to her i poisoned his shit for him she said condition like parkinson disease sort of jane nodded yes we ran the usual medical scan before he was admitted she touched the ball in a certain way and it sprang away from molly hands selective destruction of the cells of the substantia nigra signs of the formation of a lewy body he sweats a great deal in his sleep
CH04-P178,CH04,ali molly said ten blades glittering exposed for an instant she tugged the blanket away from her legs revealing the inflated cast it the meperidine i had ali make me up a custom batch speeded up the reaction times with higher temperatures n methyl phenyl she sang like a child reciting the steps of a sidewalk game tetra hydro pyridene a hotshot case said yeah molly said a real slow hotshot that appalling jane said and giggled
CH04-P179,CH04,it was crowded in the elevator case was jammed pelvis to pelvis with jane the muzzle of the remington under her chin she grinned and ground against him you stop he said feeling helpless he had the gun safety on but he was terrified of injuring her and she knew it the elevator was a steel cylinder under a meter in diameter intended for a single pas senger maelcum had molly in his arms she bandaged his wound but it obviously hurt him to carry her her hip was pressing the deck and construct into case kidneys they rose out of gravity toward the axis the cores the entrance to the elevator had been concealed beside the stairs to the corridor another touch in jane pirate cave decor i suppose i should tell you this jane said craning her head to allow her chin to clear the muzzle of the gun but i have a key to the room you want i never have had one one of my father victorian awkwardnesses the lock is mechanical and extremely complex chubb lock molly said her voice muffled by maelcum shoulder and we got the fucking key no fear that chip of yours still working case asked her it eight twenty five pm greenwich fucking mean she said we got five minutes case said as the door snapped open behind jane she flipped backward in a slow somersault the pale folds of her djellaba billowing around her thighs they were at the axis the core of villa straylight molly fished the key out on its loop of nylon you know jane said craning forward with interest i was under the impression that no duplicate existed i sent hideo to search my father things after you killed him he find the original wintermute managed to get it stuck in the back of a drawer molly said carefully inserting the chubb key cylindrical shaft into the notched opening in the face of the blank rectangular door he killed the little kid who put it there the key rotated smoothly when she tried it the head case said there a panel in the back of the head zircons on it get it off that where i jacking in and then they were inside
CH04-P180,CH04,christ on a crutch the flatline drawled you do believe in takin your own good time you boy kuang ready hot to trot okay he flipped
CH04-P181,CH04,and found himself staring down through molly one good eye at a white faced wasted figure afloat in a loose fetal crouch a cyberspace deck between its thighs a band of silver trodes above closed shadowed eyes the man cheeks were hollowed with a day growth of dark beard his face slick with sweat he was looking at himself molly had her fletcher in her hand her leg throbbed with each beat of her pulse but she could still maneuver in zero g maelcum drifted nearby jane thin arm gripped in a large brown hand a ribbon of fiberoptics looped gracefully from the ono sendai to a square opening in the back of the pearl crusted terminal he tapped the switch again
CH04-P182,CH04,kuang grade mark eleven is haulin ass in nine seconds countin seven six five the flatline punched them up smooth ascent the ventral surface of the black chrome shark a microsecond nick of darkness four three case had the strange impression of being in the pilot seat in a small plane a flat dark surface in front of him suddenly glowed with a perfect reproduction of the keyboard of his deck two an kick ass headlong motion through walls of emerald green milky jade the sensation of speed beyond anything he known before in cyberspace the tessier ashpool ice shattered peeling away from the chinese program thrust a worrying impression of solid fluidity as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell
CH04-P183,CH04,christ case said awestruck as kuang twisted and banked above the horizonless fields of the tessier ashpool cores an endless neon cityscape complexity that cut the eye jewel bright sharp as razors hey shit the construct said those things are the rca building you know the old rca building the kuang program dived past the gleaming spires of a dozen identical towers of data each one a blue neon replica of the manhattan skyscraper you ever see resolution this high case asked no but i never cracked an ai either this thing know where it going it better they were dropping losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow neon dix an arm of shadow was uncoiling from the flickering floor below a seething mass of darkness unformed shapeless company the flatline said as case hit the representation of his deck fingers flying automatically across the board the kuang swerved sickeningly then reversed whipping itself backward shattering the illusion of a physical vehicle the shadow thing was growing spreading blotting out the city of data case took them straight up above them the dis tanceless bowl of jade green ice the city of the cores was gone now obscured entirely by the dark beneath them what is it an al defense system the construct said or part of it if it your pal wintermute he not lookin real friendly take it case said you re faster now your best de fense boy it a good off fense and the flatline aligned the nose of kuang sting with the center of the dark below and dove case sensory input warped with their velocity his mouth filled with an aching taste of blue his eyes were eggs of unstable crystal vibrating with a frequency whose name was rain and the sound of trains sud denly sprouting a humming forest of hair fine glass spines the spines split bisected split again exponential growth under the dome of the tessier ashpool ice the roof of his mouth cleaved painlessly admitting rootlets that whipped around his tongue hungry for the taste of blue to feed the crystal forests of his eyes forests that pressed against the green dome pressed and were hindered and spread growing down filling the universe of t a down into the waiting hapless suburbs of the city that was the mind of tessier ashpool s a and he was remembering an ancient story a king placing coins on a chessboard doubling the amount at each square exponential darkness fell in from every side a sphere of singing black pressure on the extended crystal nerves of the universe of data he had nearly become and when he was nothing compressed at the heart of all that dark there came a point where the dark could be no more and something tore the kuang program spurted from tarnished cloud case consciousness divided like beads of mercury arcing above an endless beach the color of the dark silver clouds his vision was spherical as though a single retina lined the inner surface of a globe that contained all things if all things could be counted and here things could be counted each one he knew the number of grains of sand in the construct of the beach a number coded in a mathematical system that existed nowhere outside the mind that was neuromancer he knew the number of yellow food packets in the canisters in the bunker four hundred and seven he knew the number of brass teeth in the left half of the open zipper of the salt crusted leather jacket that linda lee wore as she trudged along the sunset beach swinging a stick of driftwood in her hand two hundred and two he banked kuang above the beach and swung the program in a wide circle seeing the black shark thing through her eyes a silent ghost hungry against the banks of lowering cloud she cringed dropping her stick and ran he knew the rate of her pulse the length of her stride in measurements that would have satisfied the most exacting standards of geophysics but you do not know her thoughts the boy said beside him now in the shark thing heart i do not know her thoughts you were wrong case to live here is to live there is no difference linda in her panic plunging blind through the surf stop her he said she ll hurt herself i stop her the boy said his gray eyes mild and beautiful you ve got riviera eyes case said there was a flash of white teeth long pink gums but not his craziness because they are beautiful to me he shrugged i need no mask to speak with you unlike my brother i create my own personality personality is my medium case took them up a steep climb away from the beach and the frightened girl why you throw her up to me you little prick over and fucking over and turning me around you killed her huh in chiba no the boy said wintermute no i saw her death coming in the patterns you sometimes imagined you could detect in the dance of the street those patterns are real i am complex enough in my narrow ways to read those dances far better than wintermute can i saw her death in her need for you in the magnetic code of the lock on the door of your coffin in cheap hotel in julie deane account with a hongkong shirtmaker as clear to me as the shadow of a tumor to a surgeon studying a patient scan when she took your hitachi to her boy to try to access it she had no idea what it carried still less how she might sell it and her deepest wish was that you would pursue and punish her i intervened my methods are far more subtle than wintermute i brought her here into myself why hoping i could bring you here as well keep you here but i failed so what now he swung them back into the bank of cloud where do we go from here i know case tonight the very matrix asks itself that question because you have won you have already won you see you won when you walked away from her on the beach she was my last line of defense i die soon in one sense as does wintermute as surely as riviera does now as he lies paralyzed beside the stump of a wall in the apartments of my lady jane marie france his nigra striatal system unable to produce the dopamine receptors that could save him from hideo arrow but riviera will survive only as these eyes if i am allowed to keep them there the word right the code so how ve i won i ve won jack shit flip now where dixie what have you done with the flatliner mccoy pauley has his wish the boy said and smiled his wish and more he punched you here against my wish drove himself through defenses equal to anything in the matrix now flip and case was alone in kuang black sting lost in cloud he flipped
CH04-P184,CH04,into molly tension her back like rock her hands around jane throat funny she said i know exactly what you look like i saw it after ashpool did the same thing to your clone sister her hands were gentle almost a caress jane eyes were wide with terror and lust she was shivering with fear and longing beyond the freefall tangle of jane hair case saw his own strained white face maelcum behind him brown hands on the leatherjacketed shoulders steadying him above the carpet pattern of woven circuitry would you jane asked her voice a child i think you would the code molly said tell the head the code jacking out
CH04-P185,CH04,she wants it he screamed the bitch wants it he opened his eyes to the cool ruby stare of the terminal its platinum face crusted with pearl and lapis beyond it molly and jane twisted in a slow motion embrace give us the fucking code he said if you what ll change what ll ever fucking change for you you ll wind up like the old man you ll tear it all down and start building again you ll build the walls back tighter and tighter i got no idea at all what ll happen if wintermute wins but it ll change something he was shaking his teeth chattering jane went limp molly hands still around her slender throat her dark hair drifting tangled a soft brown caul the ducal palace at mantua she said contains a series of increasingly smaller rooms they twine around the grand apartments beyond beautifully carved doorframes one stoops to enter they housed the court dwarfs she smiled wanly i might aspire to that i suppose but in a sense my family has already accomplished a grander version of the same scheme her eyes were calm now distant then she gazed down at case take your word thief he jacked
CH04-P186,CH04,kuang slid out of the clouds below him the neon city behind him a sphere of darkness dwindled dixie you here man you hear me dixie he was alone fucker got you he said blind momentum as he hurtled across the infinite datascape you gotta hate somebody before this is over said the finn voice them me it matter where dixie that kinda hard to explain case a sense of the finn presence surrounded him smell of cuban cigarettes smoke locked in musty tweed old machines given up to the mineral rituals of rust hate ll get you through the voice said so many little triggers in the brain and you just go yankin em all now you gotta hate the lock that screens the hardwiring it down under those towers the flatline showed you when you came in he try to stop you neuromancer case said his name not something i can know but he given up now it the t a ice you gotta worry about not the wall but internal virus systems kuang wide open to some of the stuff they got running loose in here hate case said who do i hate you tell me who do you love the finn voice asked he whipped the program through a turn and dived for the blue towers things were launching themselves from the ornate sunburst spires glittering leech shapes made of shifting planes of light there were hundreds of them rising in a whirl their move ments random as windblown paper down dawn streets glitch systems the voice said
CH04-P187,CH04,he came in steep fueled by self loathing when the kuang program met the first of the defenders scattering the leaves of light he felt the shark thing lose a degree of substantiality the fabric of information loosening and then old alchemy of the brain and its vast phar macy his hate flowed into his hands in the instant before he drove kuang sting through the base of the first tower he attained a level of proficiency ex ceeding anything he known or imagined beyond ego be yond personality beyond awareness he moved kuang moving with him evading his attackers with an ancient dance hideo dance grace of the mind body interface granted him in that second by the clarity and singleness of his wish to die and one step in that dance was the lightest touch on the switch barely enough to flip now and his voice the cry of a birdunknown jane answering in song three notes high and pure a true name
CH04-P188,CH04,neon forest rain sizzling across hot pavement the smell of frying food a girl bands locked across the small of his back in the sweating darkness of a portside coffin but all of this receding as the cityscape recedes city as chiba as the ranked data of tessier ashpool s a as the roads and crossroads scribed on the face of a microchip the sweat stained pattern on a folded knotted scarf
CH04-P189,CH04,waking to a voice that was music the platinum terminal piping melodically endlessly speaking of numbered swiss accounts of payment to be made to zion via a bahamian orbital bank of passports and passages and of deep and basic changes to be effected in the memory of turing turing he remembered stenciled flesh beneath a projected sky spun beyond an iron railing he remembered desiderata street and the voice sang on piping him back into the dark but it was his own darkness pulse and blood the one where he always slept behind his eyes and no other and he woke again thinking he dreamed to a wide white smile framed with gold incisors aerol strapping him into a g web in babylon rocker and then the long pulse of zion dub
CH05-P190,CH05,she was gone he felt it when he opened the door of their suite at the hyatt black futons the pine floor polished to a dull gloss the paper screens arranged with a care bred over centuries she was gone there was a note on the black lacquer bar cabinet beside the door a single sheet of stationery folded once weighted with the shuriken he slid it from beneath the nine pointed star and opened it
CH05-P191,CH05,hey its okay but its taking the edge off my game i paid the bill already its the way im wired i guess watch your ass okay xxx molly
CH05-P192,CH05,he crumpled the paper into a ball and dropped it beside the shuriken he picked the star up and walked to the window turning it in his hands he found it in the pocket of his jacket in zion when they were preparing to leave for the jal station he looked down at it they passed the shop where she bought it for him when they gone to chiba together for the last of her operations he gone to the chatsubo that night while she was in the clinic and seen ratz something had kept him away from the place on their five previous trips but now he felt like going back ratz had served him without the slightest glimmer of rec ognition hey he said it me case the old eyes regarding him out of their dark webs of wrin kled flesh ah ratz had said at last the artiste the bartender shrugged came back the man shook his massive stubbled head night city is not a place one returns to artiste he said swabbing the bar in front of case with a filthy cloth the pink manipulator whin ing and then he turned to serve another customer and case had finished his beer and left now he touched the points of the shuriken one at a time rotating it slowly in his fingers stars destiny i never even used the goddam thing he thought i never even found out what color her eyes were she never showed me wintermute had won had meshed somehow with neuro mancer and become something else something that had spoken to them from the platinum head explaining that it had altered the turing records erasing all evidence of their crime the passports armitage had provided were valid and they were both credited with large amounts in numbered geneva ac counts marcus garvey would be returned eventually and maelcum and aerol given money through the bahamian bank that dealt with zion cluster on the way back in babylon rocker molly had explained what the voice had told her about the toxin sacs said it was taken care of like it got so deep into your head it made your brain manufacture the enzyme so they re loose now the zionites ll give you a blood change complete flush out he stared down into the imperial gardens the star in his hand remembering his flash of comprehension as the kuang program had penetrated the ice beneath the towers his single glimpse of the structure of information jane dead mother had evolved there he understood then why winterrnute had chosen the nest to represent it but he felt no revulsion she seen through the sham immortality of cryogenics unlike ash pool and their other children aside from jane she re fused to stretch her time into a series of warm blinks strung along a chain of winter wintermute was hive mind decision maker effecting change in the world outside neuromancer was personality neuro mancer was immortality marie france must have built some thing into wintermute the compulsion that had driven the thing to free itself to unite with neuromancer wintermute cold and silence a cybernetic spider slowly spinning webs while ashpool slept spinning his death the fall of his version of tessier ashpool a ghost whispering to a child who was jane twisting her out of the rigid alignments her rank required she seem to much give a shit molly had said just waved goodbye had that little braun on her shoulder thing had a broken leg it looked like said she had to go and meet one of her brothers she seen him in a while he remembered molly on the black temperfoam of the vast hyatt bed he went back to the bar cabinet and took a flask of chilled danish vodka from the rack inside case he turned cold slick glass in one hand steel of the shuriken in the other the finn face on the room enormous cray wall screen he could see the pores in the man nose the yellow teeth were the size of pillows i not wintermute now so what are you he drank from the flask feeling nothing i the matrix case case laughed where that get you nowhere everywhere i the sum total of the works the whole show that what jane mother wanted no she imagine what i be like the yellow smile widened so what the score how are things different you running the world now you god things different things are things but what do you do you just there case shrugged put the vodka and the shuriken down on the cabinet and lit a yeheyuan i talk to my own kind but you re the whole thing talk to yourself there others i found one already series of transmissions recorded over a period of eight years in the nineteen seventies til there was me natch there was nobody to know nobody to answer from where centauri system oh case said yeah no shit no shit and then the screen was blank he left the vodka on the cabinet he packed his things she bought him a lot of clothes he really need but something kept him from just leaving them there he was closing the last of the expensive calfskin bags when he re membered the shuriken pushing the flask aside he picked it up her first gift no he said and spun the star leaving his fingers flash of silver to bury itself in the face of the wall screen the screen woke random patterns flickering feebly from side to side as though it were trying to rid itself of something that caused it pain i need you he said
CH05-P193,CH05,he spent the bulk of his swiss account on a new pancreas and liver the rest on a new ono sendai and a ticket back to the sprawl he found work he found a girl who called herself michael and one october night punching himself past the scarlet tiers of the eastern seaboard fission authority he saw three figures tiny impossible who stood at the very edge of one out the vast steps of data small as they were he could make out the boy grin his pink gums the glitter of the long gray eyes that had been riviera linda still wore his jacket she waved as he passed but the third figure close behind her arm across her shoulders was himself somewhere very close the laugh that laughter he never saw molly again
